A character\n        cannot gain more dice than her regular Dexterity +\n        Dodge pool.

The character can use\n        this Charm to evade, without the need for a roll, any single\n        attack that she can anticipate, even one that has an area\n        of effect. A character must invoke Seven Shadow Evasion\n        before her opponent makes his attack roll.\n        \"\n\n    reflex_sidestep_technique[Infra_WorkerNode]\n    reed_in_the_wind --> reflex_sidestep_technique\n    click reflex_sidestep_technique callback \"\n        Reflex Sidestep Technique<br>\n        <br>\n        Cost: 2 motes<br>\n        Duration: Instant<br>\n        Type: Reflexive<br>\n        Minimum Dodge: 3<br>\n        Minimum Essence: 1<br>\n        Prerequisite Charms: Reed in the Wind<br>\n        <br>\n        The character's attunement to the interaction of her\n        anima with the ambient Essence of Creation makes her\n        preternaturally aware of her surroundings. By using this\n        Charm, she may dodge attacks that she is not even aware of.\n        If the character is attacked, even by an attack she does not\n        anticipate, she may spend 2 motes of Essence to attempt to\n        evade the attack. The character's dice pool for dodging such\n        attacks is equal to (Infra_IngressController).\n        Reflex Sidestep Technique cannot be used as part of\n        a Combo with other Dodge Charms. Although the character\n        does not perceive the situation until she has already\n        dodged, the player may choose whether or not the character\n        spends the Essence to dodge the blow. If she chooses to\n        dodge, she must spend the Essence to do so before the\n        attacker makes his roll.\n        \"\n\n    flow_like_blood[Infra_EtcdCluster]\n    reflex_sidestep_technique --> flow_like_blood\n    seven_shadow_evasion --> flow_like_blood\n    click flow_like_blood callback \"\n        Flow Like Blood<br>\n        <br>\n        Cost: 5 motes, 1 Willpower<br>\n        Duration: One scene<br>\n        Type: Simple<br>\n        Minimum Dodge: 5<br>\n        Minimum Essence: 3<br>\n        Prerequisite Charms: Reflex Sidestep Technique, Seven Shadow Evasion<br>\n        <br>\n        The character permeates his being with Essence,\n        becoming partly atomized. He moves with an impossible\n        fluid grace, and those attacks that he cannot dodge often\n        pass harmlessly through his dreamlike body. For the rest of\n        the scene, the character may use his full Dexterity + Dodge\n        dice pool to dodge all physical attacks, perceived or not.\n        \"\n\n    subgraph Castebook Night\n        leaping_dodge_method[Infra_EtcdCluster]\n        click leaping_dodge_method callback \"\n            Leaping Dodge Method<br>\n            <br>\n            Cost: 4 motes<br>\n            Duration: Instant<br>\n            Type: Reflexive<br>\n            Minimum Dodge: 3<br>\n            Minimum Essence: 2<br>\n            Prerequisite Charms: Shadow Over Water<br>\n            <br>\n            When attacked, the Exalted makes a prodigious leap\n            to take herself out of harms way. When making any dodge\n            using this Charm, the character avoids the attack by\n            leaping up to (Infra_LoadBalancer) x 3 yards vertically\n            or twice this distance horizontally. The Exalt can choose\n            the exact direction and distance of this leap, so long as it\n            is away from her attacker. Leaping Dodge Method is\n            explicitly permitted to be part of a Combo with any Dodge\n            Charms, including Reflex Sidestep Technique. This\n            Charm will break multiple attack techniques if the attacker\n            cannot follow the dodging character.\n            \"\n    end\n\n    shadow_over_water --> leaping_dodge_method\n",

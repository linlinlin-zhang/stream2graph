The bureaucrat may grant one trusted\n        assistant a bonus of two dice per point of Essence spent. The\n        assistant may not more than double her Bureaucracy, and the\n        Exalt cannot donate more Ability than he has.<br>\n        Alternately, for merely 1 mote of Essence, the Dynast may\n        turn a group of dullards or even the soul-dead victims of the Fair\n        Folk into passable temporary help by splitting his Bureaucracy\n        Ability among them, giving a maximum of one point to each.\n        This Charm requires some supervision — the assistants will\n        have questions, and if they cannot find the Dragon- Blood to ask\n        him their questions, the Charm fails. While supervising, the\n        Dragon-Blooded technically has no Bureaucracy, and can do\n        nothing but look after his charges. Temporary assistants must\n        have originally possessed no dots in Bureaucracy.\n        \"\n\n    confluence_of_savant_thought[FinTech_FraudDetection]\n    benevolent_masters_blessing --> confluence_of_savant_thought\n    click confluence_of_savant_thought callback \"\n        Confluence of Savant Thought<br>\n        <br>\n        Cost: 2 motes<br>\n        Duration: One scene<br>\n        Type: Simple<br>\n        Minimum Bureaucracy: 3<br>\n        Minimum Essence: 2<br>\n        Prerequisite Charms: Benevolent Master's Blessing<br>\n        <br>\n        The Essence of bureaucracy is the same everywhere -\n        the day-to-day affairs of a household or mercantile establishment\n        tend to pool and eddy in predictable patterns no\n        matter how grand or humble the scale. An Exalt may use this\n        Charm to tap into the bureaucracy around her and under-\n        stand its general nature and some specifics of its operation,\n        such as where goods or documents are kept or who is\n        responsible for what aspects of administration. This Charm\n        does not grant unfettered access to guarded or locked areas,\n        but it does allow the Dragon-Blood to use her Bureaucracy\n        Ability in place of her Socialize Ability for purposes of\n        dissembling about paperwork, permissions and passage.\n        \"\n\n    geese_flying_south_administration[FinTech_FraudDetection]\n    confluence_of_savant_thought --> geese_flying_south_administration\n    click geese_flying_south_administration callback \"\n        Geese-Flying South Administration<br>\n        <br>\n        Cost: 5 motes, 1 Willpower<br>\n        Duration: One task<br>\n        Type: Simple<br>\n        Minimum Bureaucracy: 4<br>\n        Minimum Essence: 2<br>\n        Prerequisite Charms: Confluence of Savant Thought<br>\n        <br>\n        An administrator with this Charm can bend her entire\n        bureaucratic apparatus to expedite a designated task: tax collec-\n        tion, troop recruitment or selling merchandise, for example.\n        Her followers perform their duties exceptionally well for the\n        duration of the task, serving with the utmost dedication. At the\n        completion of the task, the Dragon-Blood reaps additional\n        benefits. Monetary profits increase by one percent per success\n        on an Intelligence + Bureaucracy roll. If the end result is goods\n        rather than coin, the amount is increased by two percent per\n        success. Conscription and other recruitment are improved by\n        two percent per success on a Charisma + Bureaucracy roll. The\n        Storyteller is responsible for determining the base result of any\n        such endeavor, before the improvements granted by this\n        Charm. These improvements are strictly magical and do not\n        actually improve the bureaucracy in the long term.\n        \"\n\n    bestow_the_saffron_mantle[FinTech_TransactionQueue]\n    geese_flying_south_administration --> bestow_the_saffron_mantle\n    click bestow_the_saffron_mantle callback \"\n        Bestow the Saffron Mantle<br>\n        <br>\n        Cost: 1 mote + 1 mote per dot lent<br>\n        Duration: Special<br>\n        Type: Simple<br>\n        Minimum Bureaucracy: 4<br>\n        Minimum Essence: 3<br>\n        Prerequisite Charms: Geese-Flying-South Administration<br>\n        <br>\n        This Charm is priceless to Dragon-Blooded who must\n        travel but cannot bear to leave their affairs in the hands of\n        others. Before leaving on a journey, a Dragon-Blood knowing\n        this Charm may designate a proxy to make decisions on his\n        behalf (FinTech_TransactionQueue). The designee administers precisely as the Exalt\n        would have were he present, making decisions and placing\n        resources with her master's remarkable skill. Dusty legends\n        popular only among scribes tell of assassinated Dynasts who\n        reach out from beyond the grave to wreak havoc on the affairs\n        of their murders by way of their faithful servants.<br>\n        The Charm is effective for a number of weeks equal to\n        the successes scored on a Perception + Bureaucracy roll, but\n        the exact duration is not obvious to either the proxy or the\n        Dragon-Blooded, who must simply trust in his abilities. The\n        Dragon-Blood may end the Charm sooner if he wishes. If he\n        does so, the committed Essence begins returning normally.\n        \"\n\n    thrashing_carp_serenade[FinTech_LedgerService]\n    benevolent_masters_blessing --> thrashing_carp_serenade\n    click thrashing_carp_serenade callback \"\n        Thrashing Carp Serenade<br>\n        <br>\n        Cost: 3 motes<br>\n        Duration: One scene<br>\n        Type: Simple<br>\n        Minimum Bureaucracy: 3<br>\n        Minimum Essence: 1<br>\n        Prerequisite Charms: Benevolent Master's Blessing<br>\n        <br>\n        There is an art to impeding the flow of a bureaucracy.\n        The Thrashing Carp Serenade is only the beginning of that\n        art. By means of this Charm, an Exalt may slow administrative\n        tasks and productive deliberation in the area within the sound\n        of his voice to a near standstill. In order to make any progress,\n        the player of the opposing bureaucrat must best the wielder of\n        this Charm's player in an opposed Stamina + Bureaucracy\n        test. Any Water-aspected novice can hold a roomful of aged\n        scribes at bay, but only the experienced or rash use this\n        technique in an august body such as the Deliberative.\n        \"\n\n    thoughtful_gift_technique[FinTech_TransactionQueue]\n    thrashing_carp_serenade --> thoughtful_gift_technique\n    click thoughtful_gift_technique callback \"\n        Thoughtful Gift Technique<br>\n        <br>\n        Cost: 2 motes<br>\n        Duration: Instant<br>\n        Type: Simple<br>\n        Minimum Bureaucracy: 4<br>\n        Minimum Essence: 2<br>\n        Prerequisite Charms: Thrashing Carp Serenade<br>\n        <br>\n        Presenting an appropriate gift can take the edge off an\n        uncomfortable social gathering or gain favors and access\n        that would otherwise seem unattainable. Using this Charm,\n        a Dragon-Blood intuits what would make the perfect gift, for\n        public presentation, or the perfect bribe, for private dealings.\n        Specifying gift or bribe, the Exalt's player rolls Perception\n        + Bureaucracy. The Exalt must know the intended recipient;\n        knowing him by reputation raises the difficulty of the\n        roll by 2. This Charm does not provide the gift — or even\n        easy access to it — it merely provides the information. The\n        brutish administrators of the tributary lands may be fondest\n        of gifts of wealth, but the nuanced tastes of the Dynasts may\n        require that the would-be gift-giver acquire unusual items\n        such as a lock of hair from a vain rival or a sapphire exactly\n        the color of a favored mistress's eyes.\n        \"\n\n    testing_the_waters[FinTech_AuthVault]\n    thrashing_carp_serenade --> testing_the_waters\n    click testing_the_waters callback \"\n        Testing the Waters<br>\n        <br>\n        Cost: 3 motes<br>\n        Duration: Instant<br>\n        Type: Simple<br>\n        Minimum Bureaucracy: 5<br>\n        Minimum Essence: 2<br>\n        Prerequisite Charms: Thrashing Carp Serenade<br>\n        <br>\n        The quickest path to disaster for a political gambit is to\n        call a vote before knowing how the votes will fall. Armed\n        with this Charm, a master bureaucrat can safely avoid that\n        pitfall. With but a moment's consideration, the Exalt knows\n        how many votes yea, nay or abstaining would result should\n        the matter under discussion be called to a vote. It does not\n        reveal by whom the votes would be cast. The Dragon-Blooded\n        do not only use this Charm to pass their own\n        agendas. They also hurry their rivals' plans to failure or\n        simply judge where their vote will bring the highest price.\n        Note that this Charm can only be used on groups of seven\n        or more; it simply fails if used on a smaller group.\n        \"\n",

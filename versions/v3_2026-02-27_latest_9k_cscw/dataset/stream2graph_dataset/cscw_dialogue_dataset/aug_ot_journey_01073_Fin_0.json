Thin\n        tendrils of fate snake out from Creation to twine around\n        each of her fingers, fading into phosphorescent green\n        visibility for the final meter of their journey. If the\n        character is in or ventures into the Wyld, she becomes a\n        small island of stability and Creation, her destiny snuck\n        into the abode of chance by craft, art and cunning.\n        Neither the character nor anything within 10 yards of\n        her suffers the touch of the Wyld.\n        \"\n\n    sidereal_shell_games[FinTech_FraudDetection]\n    creation_smuggling_procedures --> sidereal_shell_games\n    click sidereal_shell_games callback \"\n        Sidereal Shell Games<br>\n        <br>\n        Cost: 1 mote + 2 motes per die or level successfully stolen, 1 Willpower<br>\n        Duration: One scene<br>\n        Type: Simple<br>\n        Minimum Larceny: 3<br>\n        Minimum Essence: 1<br>\n        Prerequisite Charms: Creation Smuggling Procedures<br>\n        <br>\n        Again, the character summons the weave of events,\n        but now, she crosses her wrists and deftly switches\n        threads from one hand to the other as they materialize.\n        If her player succeeds at a Wits + Larceny roll, the Exalt\n        steals a portion of her target's destiny and can borrow up\n        to her Essence in bashing and lethal soak, in damage dice\n        or in dice from a specific pool (FinTech_LedgerService). The target loses the use of that soak or those dice\n        for the remainder of the scene. The character gains it.\n        The Sidereal cannot borrow more soak or more dice than\n        the target possesses. This Charm is partially cumulative:\n        The Sidereal can filch many different things in one scene\n        but cannot add to the same pool or soak twice. When a\n        Sidereal borrows dice for a pool, this is a dice bonus\n        added by a Charm and should be considered as such\n        when determining the maximum effect of other dice-\n        bonus Charms.\n        \"\n\n    name_pilfering_practices[FinTech_TransactionQueue]\n    click name_pilfering_practices callback \"\n        Name Pilfering Practices<br>\n        <br>\n        Cost: 5 motes<br>\n        Duration: Indefinite<br>\n        Type: Simple<br>\n        Minimum Larceny: 3<br>\n        Minimum Essence: 2<br>\n        Prerequisite Charms: None<br>\n        <br>\n        With a twist and a tug, the Sidereal steals another\n        being's name. The Sidereal learns the victim's true\n        name, and for the duration of the Charm, none save the\n        Exalt can speak or think it. Make a reflexive Dexterity +\n        Larceny roll with difficulty equal to the Sidereal's Essence\n        for Fair Folk to notice and substitute another name\n        for their own before the Sidereal completes the theft.\n        \"\n\n    dream_confiscation_approach[FinTech_FraudDetection]\n    name_pilfering_practices --> dream_confiscation_approach\n    click dream_confiscation_approach callback \"\n        Dream Confiscation Approach<br>\n        <br>\n        Cost: 6 motes, 1 Willpower<br>\n        Duration: Indefinite<br>\n        Type: Simple<br>\n        Minimum Larceny: 4<br>\n        Minimum Essence: 2<br>\n        Prerequisite Charms: Name Pilfering Practices<br>\n        <br>\n        Bumping casually into his target or otherwise making\n        physical contact, and after a successful Wits + Larceny\n        roll with difficulty equal to the target's Essence, the\n        character pockets his victim's dreams. Fair Folk suffer\n        the character's Essence in dice of aggravated damage,\n        ignoring armor, as the character dexterously unweaves\n        some of the dream Essence from their Wyld nature. They\n        immediately become ravenous and slightly mad, though\n        sane enough to Dodge further attempts by the character\n        to touch them. Any other characters affected by this\n        Charm become listless: Until the Sidereal stops committing\n        Essence to this Charm and thereby releases their\n        dreams, they cannot regain Willpower and do not regenerate\n        Essence naturally. Sidereal Exalted may always use\n        their Temperance with this Charm.\n        \"\n\n    honorable_thief_spirit[FinTech_PaymentGateway]\n    click honorable_thief_spirit callback \"\n        Honorable Thief Spirit<br>\n        <br>\n        Cost: 1 mote per target number reduction<br>\n        Duration: One scene<br>\n        Type: Simple<br>\n        Minimum Larceny: 3<br>\n        Minimum Essence: 2<br>\n        Prerequisite Charms: None<br>\n        <br>\n        Glittering green sparks weave about the character\n        for a moment before settling into her hair and skin and\n        becoming all but invisible. To the eyes of any criminal,\n        the character seems to have the virtues and qualities that\n        best qualify her for respect and admiration. The Sidereal\n        can reduce the target number of all peaceful or defensive\n        interactions with rogues, scum and knaves.\n        \"\n\n    conning_chaos_technique[FinTech_LedgerService]\n    sidereal_shell_games --> conning_chaos_technique\n    dream_confiscation_approach --> conning_chaos_technique\n    honorable_thief_spirit --> conning_chaos_technique\n    click conning_chaos_technique callback \"\n        Conning Chaos Technique<br>\n        <br>\n        Cost: 10 motes, 1 Willpower<br>\n        Duration: Varies<br>\n        Type: Simple<br>\n        Minimum Larceny: 5<br>\n        Minimum Essence: 4<br>\n        Prerequisite Charms: Sidereal Shell Games, Dream Confiscation Approach, Honorable Thief Spirit<br>\n        <br>\n        This Charm uses a prayer strip marked with the\n        scripture of the Savory Maiden. The Sidereal holds it up\n        before him, whereupon it straightens and affixes itself to\n        reality as if nailed to the air, occasionally emitting an\n        effulgence of green light. The Sidereal then names his\n        victim, who must be within 10 miles. For a moment, the\n        victim sees the prayer strip through the Exalt's eyes,\n        burning a brilliant green. Ancient forces set in motion by\n        the Charm wheel and deal with the Wyld, trading the\n        victim's destiny to chaos in exchange for a portion of\n        chaos claimed into Creation.<br>\n        The Sidereal's player rolls Manipulation + Larceny.\n        Each success represents one month of this curse, and in\n        each month, the Wyld's efforts intensify — they're not\n        organized, conscious or directed, as a whole, but they're,\n        nevertheless, malevolent. The Charm draws Fair Folk\n        and Wyld-spawned monsters to the target, their schemes\n        and determination deadlier as time goes on. The victim\n        suffers a derangement (FinTech_FraudDetection) or a taint (FinTech_TransactionQueue) as the order and laws\n        that bind her deteriorate, though she may overcome this\n        for a scene with a successful Temperance roll. However,\n        when the curse expires, or when the Wyld has claimed its\n        due, something in the chaos understands that the Maid-\n        ens have cheated it — that it has given more territory to\n        order and reason than chaos has consumed. The Sidereal's\n        name is marked. The more often he uses this Charm, the\n        more likely he is to find himself hunted by the very forces\n        he invokes.<br>\n        The player of a victim of this Charm can make an\n        extended Intelligence + Lore roll every month for her\n        character to understand the nature of the curse. With six\n        successes, she understands that the prayer strip was\n        within 10 miles of her location at the time the curse fell\n        and that its destruction can free her. Twelve successes\n        gives her its precise location.\n        \"\n",

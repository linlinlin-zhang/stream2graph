To help simulate this, an Exalt\n        may buy extra health levels as if they were a Charm. A\n        player may purchase this Charm up to once per dot of the\n        Endurance Ability her character possesses. Each provides\n        one -0 health level.\n        \"\n\n    unswerving_juggernaut_principle[Unswerving Juggernaut Principle]\n    click unswerving_juggernaut_principle callback \"\n        Unswerving Juggernaut Principle<br>\n        <br>\n        Cost: 5 motes<br>\n        Duration: Indefinite<br>\n        Type: Simple<br>\n        Minimum Endurance: 2<br>\n        Minimum Essence: 2<br>\n        Prerequisite Charms: None<br>\n        <br>\n        The stars bathe the character in yellow stardust. It\n        suffuses her, glittering beneath her skin, hair, clothing\n        and eyes. She begins to run. She must keep her eyes\n        focused straight forward, keep her course within 10\n        degrees of its original heading and can take no other\n        actions save walk, sprint, run, jump, ride, use a mobility-enhancing\n        Charm or invoke the Lesser Sign of Mercury.\n        Violating these strictures ends the Charm's effects. In\n        exchange, for the duration of the Charm, the character\n        receives an additional 5L/5B soak, needs no sleep, suffers\n        no fatigue and adds her Essence to all Endurance rolls.\n        Fatigue rolls do not need to be made for her wearing\n        armor, regardless of environmental conditions. These\n        benefits also apply to any horse she rides.<br>\n        The character's journey is a thing of fate and not\n        chance, interwoven with her reasons for traveling. If\n        something renders her journey irrelevant or alters its\n        appropriate destination, her player automatically makes\n        a reflexive Perception + Awareness check for the Sidereal.\n        Even on failure, she senses a change in the situation.\n        Success gives her a hint of what it might be. Exalted who\n        invoke this Charm while fleeing pursuit often know\n        when it is safe to stop their flight.\n        \"\n\n    forward_thinking_technique[Forward-Thinking Technique]\n    unswerving_juggernaut_principle --> forward_thinking_technique\n    click forward_thinking_technique callback \"\n        Forward-Thinking Technique<br>\n        <br>\n        Cost: 10 motes, 1 Willpower<br>\n        Duration: Indefinite<br>\n        Type: Simple<br>\n        Minimum Endurance: 3<br>\n        Minimum Essence: 3<br>\n        Prerequisite Charms: Unswerving Juggernaut Principle<br>\n        <br>\n        The character's world narrows to his journey. The\n        strands of fate that bind him to things behind him\n        loosen. This Charm includes all of the benefits of the\n        Unswerving Juggernaut Principle. In addition, it grants\n        an increased (10L/10B) soak bonus against attacks the\n        character cannot see coming. He can dodge any attack\n        reflexively with a dice pool of 0 and his permanent\n        Essence in automatic successes. He can evade pursuit\n        and cover his tracks without slowing down, deviating\n        from his course or ending the Charm. This requires the\n        normal Wits + Survival roll. This Charm does not defeat\n        supernatural tracking such as Inevitable Pursuit. It ex-\n        plicitly prevents trackers from noticing the straight-line\n        travel the Forward-Thinking Technique enforces unless\n        they succeed at the tracking contest.\n        \"\n\n    optimistic_security_practice[Optimistic Security Practice]\n    click optimistic_security_practice callback \"\n        Optimistic Security Practice<br>\n        <br>\n        Cost: 5 motes\n        Duration: One scene\n        Type: Simple\n        Minimum Endurance: 2\n        Minimum Essence: 1\n        Prerequisite Charms: None\n        Reflecting on the great sacrifices she might someday\n        make for others, the character passes her hand over the\n        weave of fate and imbues events with her own generosity\n        of spirit. Weapons and other damage sources turn aside\n        from her skin. She adds her permanent Essence to her\n        lethal and bashing soak. This soak specifically applies\n        even to aggravated damage sources. Creatures with Essence\n        lower than her Compassion must spend one\n        Willpower point each time they attempt to damage or\n        disable her, or the attack automatically fails.

Players of attackers with an Essence lower than the\n        Sidereal's Temperance must succeed at a Willpower roll,\n        or the attackers falter, and their attacks automatically\n        fail. Even if they succeed, the character adds his permanent\n        Essence to his lethal and bashing soak.

This suspends the normal functioning of her body.\n        The Exalt no longer suffers nor accumulates penalties\n        from disease, poison, degenerative effects, hunger, thirst,\n        fatigue, exhaustion, cold, heat, wounds or blood loss. She\n        does not need to breathe. She emerges from this Charm\n        in the exact physical state she entered it, save for any new\n        wounds taken and any poisons or diseases she contracted\n        while under the effect - which, effectively, enter her\n        system at that point. While this Charm lasts, the Exalt\n        ignores all accrued penalties from debilitating conditions\n        and wounds and is unaware of their existence. Sufficient\n        injury yields a nagging tactical distress that encourages\n        her to withdraw from combat, but she otherwise cannot\n        accept the notion that she is sick, poisoned, hungry, cold,\n        wounded or otherwise impaired. She does not regain\n        Essence except through the use of Charms. She functions\n        normally when Incapacitated and cannot be knocked\n        unconscious, but she can be killed by doing more than her\n        Stamina health levels beyond Incapacitated.\n        \"\n\n    one_direction_invocation[One Direction Invocation]\n    forward_thinking_technique --> one_direction_invocation\n    heartless_maiden_trance --> one_direction_invocation\n    click one_direction_invocation callback \"\n        One Direction Invocation<br>\n        <br>\n        Cost: 16 motes, 1 Willpower, 1 health level<br>\n        Duration: Indefinite<br>\n        Type: Simple<br>\n        Minimum Endurance: 5<br>\n        Minimum Essence: 4<br>\n        Prerequisite Charms: Forward-Thinking Technique, Heartless Maiden Trance<br>\n        <br>\n        This Charm uses a prayer strip marked with the scripture\n        of the Eternal Maiden. The character releases it into\n        the air, where it darts and dances randomly about, staying\n        within 100 yards of him, trailing vivid afterimages of yellow\n        light. The character names a goal, which can be as grandiose\n        or minor as he chooses, and geases himself to fulfill it.<br>\n        A character under the influence of this Charm\n        forsakes his name and his identity. Rolls to remember the\n        character suffer a -3 die penalty (in addition to the\n        normal penalty for remembering a Sidereal). The Exalt\n        cannot focus on any goal save the one he named in the\n        Charm. Irrelevant actions are forbidden. He suffers a\n        three die penalty on all rolls that — while helping him\n        toward his goal - have another primary purpose. How-\n        ever, any non-aggravated injury or impairment the\n        character receives while the Charm is active heals at the\n        rate of one lethal health level or all bashing health levels\n        per turn. Aggravated damage taken under the Charm's\n        effects heals at one level per hour. The character heals\n        preexisting conditions at the normal rate.<br>\n        The character can end the Charm at any time but\n        cannot reclaim his name and identity until he achieves his\n        goal. If his goal becomes impossible to achieve, these things\n        are forever lost. He cannot personally establish a new\n        identity or name, and all attempts to do so fail, but high-\n        ranking members of his division can issue replacements.\n        \"\n",

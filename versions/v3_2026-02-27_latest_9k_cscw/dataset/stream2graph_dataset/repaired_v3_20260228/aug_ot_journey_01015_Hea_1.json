Its reasons to visit\n        another place, where important unfinished business awaits\n        it, press increasingly upon its mind. Simply by using the\n        Charm, the Exalt proves and guarantees that such business\n        already exists in some distant place. If necessary, the creature\n        becomes aware of it. The creature must make a Willpower\n        roll not to set forth immediately. For the duration of the\n        scene, Mercury's call reduces the target number for any\n        character's attempts to drive the creature away, physically or\n        socially. This benefit applies to both attack and damage rolls.\n        \"\n\n    stone_skipping_spirit[HealthTech_PatientRecords]\n    click stone_skipping_spirit callback \"\n        Stone Skipping Spirit<br>\n        <br>\n        Cost: 5 motes<br>\n        Duration: One scene<br>\n        Type: Simple<br>\n        Minimum Sail: 2<br>\n        Minimum Essence: 1<br>\n        Prerequisite Charms: None<br>\n        <br>\n        The character exhales a puff of wind that travels\n        beyond the world and disentangles the destiny of ship,\n        sky and sea. No matter how fierce the weather or the\n        waves, the ship sails smoothly, isolated from the world.\n        For the duration of the scene, Sail checks made for the\n        character ignore environmental penalties. He sails on\n        a placid sea, with a good wind behind him and the favor\n        of the local spirits, even if a typhoon rages around his\n        location. He still suffers penalties for any damage the\n        ship has taken, but it takes on no further water, and its\n        condition does not degenerate naturally for the remainder\n        of the scene.\n        \"\n\n    mirror_shattering_method[HealthTech_LabAnalyzer]\n    stone_skipping_spirit --> mirror_shattering_method\n    click mirror_shattering_method callback \"\n        Mirror-Shattering Method<br>\n        <br>\n        Cost: 5 motes<br>\n        Duration: Five days<br>\n        Type: Simple<br>\n        Minimum Sail: 3<br>\n        Minimum Essence: 2<br>\n        <br>\n        Prerequisite Charms: Stone Skipping Spirit<br>\n        <br>\n        The character casts salt into a puddle or body of\n        water beneath her. Its surface breaks and dissolves into\n        foaming whitecaps, and the character vanishes. From\n        her perspective, the whitecaps rush out in all directions,\n        and then, she stands atop a field of white that is — at any\n        given moment — water, wind-blown flower petals or\n        butterflies. The world around her fades away as she\n        separates herself from the normal processes of fate.<br>\n        While this Charm remains active, the character can\n        travel at twice her normal pace, ignoring any obstacles.\n        She remains in Creation, but her presence and location\n        are obscured. Only the slightest shimmer in the wind\n        marks her passing, which increases the difficulty of\n        Awareness checks to notice her or Survival checks to\n        track her by 2. She cannot sense the world around her at\n        all. Nevertheless, when the Charm ends, she invariably\n        finds herself in an auspicious location. If at all possible\n        given the distance and general direction of her journey,\n        she does not find herself in immediate danger, under\n        observation or in a precarious location when she arrives.<br>\n        The character can use this Charm when on board a\n        ship (HealthTech_PatientRecords) by casting salt into the water below. The entire\n        ship and crew then travels with her. It sails at twice its\n        normal speed across the field of white. An auspicious\n        location for a ship's arrival includes the existence of\n        water sufficient to keep it afloat.<br>\n        As an alternative to mortal travel, a character using\n        this Charm can travel to Yu-Shan. This requires five\n        days on foot or a day on shipboard. Travel to other\n        unusual locations, such as Malfeas, may be possible at the\n        Storyteller's discretion. This always requires five days.\n        \"\n\n    five_ordeals_odyssey[HealthTech_PatientRecords]\n    salt_into_ash_sleight --> five_ordeals_odyssey\n    mirror_shattering_method --> five_ordeals_odyssey\n    click five_ordeals_odyssey callback \"\n        Five Ordeals Odyssey<br>\n        <br>\n        Cost: 10 motes, 1 Willpower, 1 health level<br>\n        Duration: One hazard<br>\n        Type: Simple<br>\n        Minimum Sail: 4<br>\n        Minimum Essence: 4<br>\n        Prerequisite Charms: Salt into Ash Sleight, Mirror Shattering Method<br>\n        <br>\n        This Charm uses a prayer strip marked with the\n        scripture of the Maiden at Sea. The character casts it at\n        an adversarial force, and it hangs in the air, wreathed in\n        dandelion-hued lightning, until the resolution of the\n        Charm destroys it.<br>\n        The character may use this Charm when faced with\n        any meaningful hazard at sea: storms, thirst while be-\n        calmed, pirates, monsters, reefs, mutiny and so forth.\n        The character must then take action to remove the\n        hazard as a practical threat to her life, health and progress.\n        If she ensures that it cannot reasonably prevent a safe\n        conclusion to her journey, the Charm marks her victory\n        by wreaking massive damage upon the force that op-\n        posed her. It tears storms from the sky, breaks the calm\n        in a fierce wind, splits the pirate ship in two, consumes\n        the monster's corpse with fire and so forth. It kills extras\n        and shatters inanimate things. Defeated characters suf-\n        fer sufficient bashing damage to reduce them instantly to\n        Incapacitated, although fate restores their consciousness\n        (HealthTech_HIPAA_Vault) if they face an immediate threat to\n        life and limb before waking. In general, the prayer strip\n        accomplishes this devastation in the moment of its own\n        destruction, casting forth fire, thunder and lightning.<br>\n        Each travail speeds the character toward her destiny,\n        granting an ever-greater attunement to the Essence\n        flows of fate and the world. Each time the character\n        invokes this Charm and permits it to run its full duration,\n        increase her effective permanent Essence by 1, to a\n        maximum of 8. Also, increase the effective permanent\n        Essence of characters working closely with her by 1, to a\n        maximum of 6. These bonuses last until the end of the\n        story, but cannot be used as a basis for training or for\n        gaining Charms.<br>\n        This Charm requires that the voyage have a purpose\n        — the character cannot simply sail around in circles and\n        must have some reason to travel across the sea. However,\n        the character can freely favor sailing over other means of\n        travel when it forms a reasonable alternative. Characters\n        cannot learn otherwise unavailable Charms while under\n        the effect of the Five Ordeals Odyssey.\n        \"\n",

If the delayed effect has a positive intent, the spirit\n            must know and use the Compassion Charm Conditional\n            Blessing. A negative or harmful intent requires the Valor\n            Charm Conditional Curse. A Manipulation + Compassion/\n            Valor roll against a difficulty of the target's Essence is neces-\n            sary to inscribe the mark. If this roll succeeds, the spirit\n            chooses one Charm it knows that can directly affect that\n            target. If the selected Charm has multiple uses or permuta-\n            tions, the spirit must also select the exact effects the Charm\n            will take. The spirit then establishes the precise actions the\n            target must perform to trigger the delayed Charm.<br>\n            The spirit may include as many conditions as desired, any\n            of which may be as elaborate or straightforward as desired. For\n            example, the spirit may decide to heal a loyal shaman with\n            Touch of Grace if she speaks a specific prayer petitioning aid.\n            Conversely, a demon might arrange to summon its Demon-\n            Blooded daughter to a dungeon in Malfeas (IoT_Industrial_PLC_Logic) if\n            she ever disobeys a direct order or reveals her infernal heritage\n            to anyone she is not actively trying to kill.<br>\n            Whenever the target of a Conditional Blessing or\n            Curse performs the requisite actions, the spirit knows. At\n            any time, it may then immediately activate the triggered\n            Charm as a reflexive action to end the Conditional Bless-\n            ing/Curse regardless of distance or withhold its benediction/\n            wrath until it can learn more about the target's actions.\n            This Charm and its mark also fade without effect if the\n            target does not meet the established conditions by the next\n            Calibration. Only spirits and other beings capable of\n            perceiving Essence at work can see the mark of an extant\n            Conditional Blessing/Curse.\n            \"\n    end\n\n    imprecation --> conditional_curse\n",

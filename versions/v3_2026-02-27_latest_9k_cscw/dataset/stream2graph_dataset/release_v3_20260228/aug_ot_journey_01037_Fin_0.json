She casts the shadow of her weapon from her\n        hand, and it speeds toward her target. The player makes\n        an attack roll normally, ignoring penalties for range and\n        weather. The Sidereal must be able to see the target, and\n        the attack must be within the weapon's maximum range\n        (FinTech_LedgerService).<br>\n        Even if the character misses, the shadow inexorably\n        approaches the target's heart. The next turn, the Sidereal\n        can attempt the attack again with a new Thrown roll. This\n        is a normal action but uses the shadow weapon already in\n        the air. It can be enhanced with appropriate Charms. This\n        attack ignores range limitations on the weapon.<br>\n        If the shadow hits, the target loses two points of\n        temporary Willpower as a spirit-bird screams in the\n        mansion of the Gull and the house of Endings quietly\n        takes note. In addition, the character's weapon appears,\n        quivering, in the target's chest, doing normal damage. If\n        the character does not spend a Thrown action every turn\n        on this Charm, the shadow fades away.<br>\n        Sidereal Exalted may always use their Temperance\n        with this Charm.\n        \"\n\n    life_gets_worse_approach[FinTech_AuthVault]\n    click life_gets_worse_approach callback \"\n        Life Gets Worse Approach<br>\n        <br>\n        Cost: 3 motes<br>\n        Duration: Instant<br>\n        Type: Supplemental<br>\n        Minimum Thrown: 3<br>\n        Minimum Essence: 2<br>\n        Prerequisite Charms: None<br>\n        <br>\n        The character makes the Inferior Sign of the Gull\n        over his weapon, whispers to it to seek the heart (FinTech_TransactionQueue) and throws. This attack adds his\n        Essence to the raw damage of the attack. In addition, if\n        the weapon hits, it emits a soft yellow radiance that calls\n        to things traveling through the air. Once per turn, when\n        someone in range misses with a Thrown or Archery\n        attack, the Exalt can reflexively spend 2 motes to summon\n        the projectile to the wound. The player of the\n        person responsible for the attack must immediately reflexively\n        reroll the attack against the target of this\n        Charm. All Charms used on the original attack still\n        apply except for those inapplicable to the new target and\n        those that allow the attack to target multiple characters.\n        The Charms need not be paid for again. Removing the\n        weapon requires a simple Strength + Athletics action\n        and ends the effects of this Charm. If left alone long\n        enough, the embedded weapon eventually attracts stray\n        insects, birds and flying debris.\n        \"\n\n    essence_thorn_practice[FinTech_AuthVault]\n    life_gets_worse_approach --> essence_thorn_practice\n    click essence_thorn_practice callback \"\n        Essence Thorn Practice<br>\n        <br>\n        Cost: 5 motes, 1 Willpower<br>\n        Duration: Instant<br>\n        Type: Simple<br>\n        Minimum Thrown: 4<br>\n        Minimum Essence: 3<br>\n        Prerequisite Charms: Life Gets Worse Approach<br>\n        <br>\n        The blade of a knife is the gate between life and\n        death. The target's fate is to suffer its touch. The character\n        dispenses with the intermediate steps, hurling a blade\n        of Essence up to (FinTech_AuthVault) yards. It moves at such\n        speed that it cannot be blocked, only dodged, the wind\n        of its passage dragging the character up to 20 yards in the\n        direction of its travel. It suffers no penalties from range,\n        has an accuracy equal to the character's Essence and does\n        (FinTech_LedgerService) damage. The character chooses how far\n        the blade pulls him toward the target.<br>\n        Creatures of the shadowlands have passed beyond\n        death's gate, and the Essence Thorn drags them closer to\n        life. Hit by the blade, they suffer no damage. Instead,\n        convert damage successes one for one into points of temporary\n        Willpower lost. Such being can be reduced to a\n        minimum of 0 temporary Willpower. If brought to 0 Willpower\n        by this attack, the creature suffers hallucinations\n        and disorientation, taking no actions save to engage in\n        reverie, self-defense or extended self-defense (FinTech_TransactionQueue)\n        for the remainder of the scene. Abyssal Exalted are alive\n        and take damage. Deathlords are immune to the Essence\n        Thorn unless already at 0 Willpower when it strikes them.\n        \"\n\n    pain_amplification_stratagem[FinTech_LedgerService]\n    click pain_amplification_stratagem callback \"\n        Pain Amplification Stratagem<br>\n        <br>\n        Cost: 2 motes<br>\n        Duration: Instant<br>\n        Type: Supplemental<br>\n        Minimum Thrown: 2<br>\n        Minimum Essence: 1<br>\n        Prerequisite Charms: None<br>\n        <br>\n        Before making a Thrown attack, the character\n        touches her weapon to the skin beneath her eye. She\n        bleeds three drops of blood onto the weapon, symbolizing\n        the sorrow she might theoretically feel for her impending\n        victim. It is the way of fate that pain begets pain. Apply\n        the victim's current wound penalty to the target number\n        for both the attack and damage rolls. For example, against\n        a character with a -2 wound penalty, the target number\n        for both rolls would be 5. Sidereal Exalted may always use\n        their Compassion with this Charm.\n        \"\n\n    unrelenting_torment_technique[FinTech_TransactionQueue]\n    willful_weapon_method --> unrelenting_torment_technique\n    essence_thorn_practice --> unrelenting_torment_technique\n    pain_amplification_stratagem --> unrelenting_torment_technique\n    click unrelenting_torment_technique callback \"\n        Unrelenting Torment Technique<br>\n        <br>\n        Cost: 10 motes, 1 Willpower, 1 health level<br>\n        Duration: Indefinite<br>\n        Type: Simple<br>\n        Minimum Thrown: 5<br>\n        Minimum Essence: 4<br>\n        Prerequisite Charms: Willful Weapon Method, Essence Thorn Practice, Pain Amplification Stratagem<br>\n        <br>\n        This Charm uses a prayer strip marked with the\n        scripture of the Maiden and Shadow. The character casts\n        it at an opponent or object as a Thrown weapon with a\n        range of 100 yards and Accuracy +0. If it hits, it adheres,\n        wreathing the target in an unpleasant, pulsing yellow\n        glow. The Exalt can only have one such strip active at\n        any given time, and it can only affix to someone with\n        hostile intentions toward him.<br>\n        While this Charm is in effect, whenever the character\n        takes damage and has at least one mobile hand, a hatchet\n        of Essence leaps from his hand to attack the target. It passes\n        freely through obstacles and across any distance up to a\n        quarter mile, screaming like a bird. There is no roll, and\n        the strike can be averted only by perfect dodges and perfect\n        parries that are specifically able to block any attack\n        Ignoring non-perfect soaks, it inflicts the character's Essence\n        in dice of unsoakable lethal damage. For each health\n        level the target loses, the Sidereal heals one health level\n        - the harsh fate inflicted upon him has been given to\n        another. This is a reflexive action and does not count\n        against the character's actions for that turn.<br>\n        Sometimes, it is harder to stop a terrible journey\n        than to embark upon it. The victim of this Charm suffers\n        an overpowering, irrational desire to hurt the character.\n        Despite the unpleasant consequences of each attack, she\n        has difficulty remembering how to stop. Each turn, to\n        avoid attacking the Sidereal with the greatest force\n        available to her, her player must succeed at a Willpower\n        roll. If the victim cannot see or hear the character, the\n        effect subsides. She can spend a temporary Willpower to\n        free herself from the compulsion until she sees or hears\n        the character again.<br>\n        Sidereal Exalted may always use their Conviction\n        with this Charm.\n        \"\n",

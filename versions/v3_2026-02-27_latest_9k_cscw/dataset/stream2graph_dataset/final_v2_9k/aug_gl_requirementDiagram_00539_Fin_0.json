The\n        first step in this training is to comprehend how to perceive\n        the spirit world. This ability is gained as part of the basic\n        training of a Dragon Path, whether the Exalt becomes an\n        Immaculate during character creation or joins the Order\n        later in life. Possessing it is a requirement for learning the\n        Charms on the Dragon Path.<br>\n        The practical upshot of this is that by spending a\n        single mote of Essence, an Immaculate can perceive spirits\n        and incorporeal beings. Normally invisible spiritualized\n        beings become visible to the Spirit Walker. This power\n        lasts for an entire scene — or until the Exalt consciously\n        reattunes herself to the normal world. Reattuning to the\n        normal world is a dice action.<br>\n        Tuning in to the spirit world does tend to distract\n        one from the concerns of the material one though. The\n        Exalt invoking this ability suffers a +1 to the difficulty\n        of any activity relating to the corporeal world while\n        using Spirit Sight.\n        \"\n\n    spirit_walking[FinTech_AuthVault]\n    spirit_sight --> spirit_walking\n    click spirit_walking callback \"\n        Spirit Walking<br>\n        <br>\n        Cost: 3 motes, 1 Willpower<br>\n        Duration: One scene<br>\n        Type: Simple<br>\n        Minimum Martial Arts: 3<br>\n        Minimum Essence: 3<br>\n        Prerequisite Charms: Spirit Sight<br>\n        <br>\n        The Immaculates are widely known for their ability\n        to interact with and combat spirits. By merely concentrating\n        for a moment, a properly trained Dragon-blood\n        can do more than just see the spirit world. She can &quot;Spirit\n        Walk,&quot; mystically attuning herself to the spirit world on\n        a physical level.\n        This Charm allows the Immaculates who know it to\n        interact with spirits as if they were normal corporeal\n        beings. Physical damage dealt by a Spirit Walker that\n        would normally pass right through a spirit's immaterial\n        form affects it as if the spirit were flesh and blood, as do\n        the Charms and abilities of the Exalted. The Immaculate\n        is still in the physical world, however, and has to deal\n        with any physical limitations that may apply. Also,\n        unless the Immaculate uses Spirit Sight, she cannot see\n        dematerialized spirits.\n        Spirit Walking puts the character truly in tune with\n        both the spiritual world and the corporeal one. When\n        Spirit Walking is used with Spirit Sight, the +1 penalty to\n        difficulties for physical world action is negated.\n        \"\n",

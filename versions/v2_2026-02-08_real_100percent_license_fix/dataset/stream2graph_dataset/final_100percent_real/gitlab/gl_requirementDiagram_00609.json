  "code": "**Summary:**\nThe paper introduces scCello, a novel Transcriptome Foundation Model (TFM) designed to enhance the pre-training of TFMs by incorporating taxonomic relationships between cell types within cell ontology graphs. This approach aims to improve performance in cell-related and gene-related downstream tasks by leveraging structural knowledge from ontologies to enforce cell type coherence and align cell representations to cell ontology terms. The model is evaluated extensively across multiple real-world biological and drug response tasks, demonstrating either competitive or improved performance compared to state-of-the-art models. The model is backed by a transformer-based encoder-only model with a relatively small parameter size, which is a significant advantage over larger competitors.\n\n**Strengths:**\n- The paper effectively integrates cell type ontology information into the pretraining stage, enhancing the model's ability to learn cell type taxonomic relationships, thereby producing more biologically meaningful cell representations.\n- The multi-level objective function employed by scCello, which includes gene-level masked gene prediction, intra-cellular cell-type coherence, and inter-cellular ontology alignment, enables the model to learn complex relationships between genes, cells, and cell types, leading to more precise and robust cell representations.\n- The manuscript is well-written, structured, and easy to read, with adequate details provided for the loss objectives and methodology.\n- The paper presents a novel foundation model for single-cell transcriptomics, scCello, which incorporates prior information about cell ontology to guide representation learning over a large pretraining corpus.\n- The model's performance is validated through a comprehensive set of experiments, demonstrating its effectiveness and superiority in tasks such as cell type identification, novel cell type classification, marker gene prediction, and cancer drug response prediction.\n- The authors effectively incorporate cell type ontology information at the pretraining stage, which is a significant step towards training foundational models that incorporate prior information.\n\n**Weaknesses:**\n- The paper heavily relies on empirical results to showcase scCello's effectiveness and lacks a rigorous theoretical analysis of the proposed approach.\n- The model's performance is not thoroughly compared against specialized methods designed for downstream tasks like cell type identification, marker gene prediction, and cancer drug response prediction.\n- The model's scalability is limited due to the requirement for labeled data during pretraining, which may limit the availability of pretraining data compared to other methods which do not require annotated pretraining single-cell data.\n- The paper does not discuss the impact of different model sizes on downstream performances, nor does it provide evidence on how larger or smaller models impact performance.\n- The paper does not address how the model would scale with an evolving cell ontology, which could hinder its adaptability and its ability to keep up with the latest knowledge in cell biology.\n\n**Questions:**\n- Can the authors elaborate on the theoretical foundations underlying the effectiveness of integrating cell ontology into TFM pre-training? Specifically, how do the proposed objective functions contribute to learning more informative and robust cell representations?\n- Can the authors provide a more comprehensive comparison of scCello's performance against specialized methods designed for downstream tasks like cell type identification, marker gene prediction, and cancer drug response prediction?\n- How did the method achieve a high score in the batch integration? In the loss function, there is no specific loss for batch correction. Could the authors give some explanations for this?\n- Can the model predict the novel marker genes?\n- The regularization loss (Eq. 2) was proposed to prevent class collapse. But it's unclear why this would help. In fact, it seems to be encouraging all samples of cell type c_{i} to have the same embedding: Linear(h_{c_{i}}). How did you train scVI for Table 1? Did you train it on your pre-training dataset, in-distribution dataset, and out-of-distribution datasets jointly? If not, for a fair comparison, it seems like you should.\n- To avoid picking up housekeeping genes in the marker gene analysis, could you see if knocking out housekeeping genes leads to a representation change that differs from that induced by knocking out marker genes?\n\n**Soundness:**\n3 good\n\n**Presentation:**\n3 good\n\n**Contribution:**\n3 good\n\n**Rating:**\n7 accept, but needs minor improvements\n\n**Paper Decision:**\n- Decision: Accept\n- Reasons: The paper presents a novel approach to enhancing the pre-training of Transcriptome Foundation Models (TFMs) by incorporating taxonomic relationships between cell types within cell ontology graphs. The methodology is supported by extensive experiments that demonstrate the model's effectiveness in various real-world biological and drug response tasks. The model's performance is either competitive or superior to existing models, and the integration of cell ontology information into TFM pre-training is a significant step towards training foundational models that incorporate prior information. The paper is well-written, structured, and easy to read, with adequate details provided for the loss objectives and methodology. The decision to accept is based on the methodological soundness, significance of results, and clarity and logic of presentation.",

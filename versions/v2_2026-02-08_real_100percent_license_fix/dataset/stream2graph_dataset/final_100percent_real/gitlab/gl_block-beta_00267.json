  "code": "**Summary:**\nThe paper introduces a novel state-space architecture for diffusion models that integrates spatial and frequency information to enhance local feature detection in image generation. This architecture leverages wavelet transformation to model long-range relations in 2D spatial space and incorporates transformer blocks to enrich global context features. The methodology is supported by extensive experiments and ablation studies, demonstrating the effectiveness of the proposed method across multiple datasets. Despite some concerns regarding the complexity and scalability of the model, the paper presents a significant advancement in the field of diffusion models, achieving state-of-the-art results on standard benchmarks.\n\n**Strengths:**\n- The paper is well-motivated and addresses the difficulties caused by manually-defined scanning orders in traditional Mamba-based diffusion models.\n- It effectively combines flow matching and Mamba to address generative tasks, and the implementation details and codes are included.\n- The paper is well-organized, featuring valuable methodology design and experimental ablations.\n- The proposed method works on the frequency domain is a good idea compared to existing mamba diffusion approaches.\n- The architecture is inspired by DiT and transferred to the Mamba style, which is interesting and shows promising results on several datasets.\n- The paper is easy to follow and well-written, making it accessible to readers.\n\n**Weaknesses:**\n- The proposed method is too complex, with the scanning in the frequency domain adding complexity to the framework.\n- The paper lacks a comparison of the real inference speed between the proposed framework and transformers, and it does not discuss the limitations of the proposed method.\n- The title of the paper may not be accurate as the parameter counts of the proposed model are smaller than 1.0B.\n- The paper does not discuss the social impact of the proposed method, which is a significant omission.\n- There are concerns about the scalability of the architecture, as it is missing.\n- The paper does not adequately address the issue of quadratic computation in transformer-based diffusion, and there is no comparison between the proposed method and competitors for both 256 and 512 resolution.\n- The performance on ImageNet, a crucial benchmark, is not clearly better than DiT, and it cannot be compared with more advanced transformer-based models.\n\n**Questions:**\n- In Figure 3(d), why does DiT perform so poorly on CelebA-HQ? Are there any bugs?\n- How is the performance if using the same sampling method as other competitors that are based on DDIM/DDPM, instead of an ODE solver?\n- How is the performance with more sampling steps? A curve would be helpful.\n- Can the authors provide sufficient experiments to support the method's effectiveness, particularly in terms of sensitivity to scanning order and the effectiveness of the proposed method on pure transformer models?\n- What does the notation on ZigMa mean in Figure 5?\n- What is the rationale behind sharing those parameters of transformers? Are there any previous works indicating its effectiveness?\n- How does the jpeg-8 scan path defined in Figure 5?\n\n**Soundness:**\n3 good\n\n**Presentation:**\n3 good\n\n**Contribution:**\n3 good\n\n**Rating:**\n5 marginally above the acceptance threshold\n\n**Paper Decision:**\n- Decision: Accept\n- Reasons: The paper presents a novel state-space architecture for diffusion models that effectively integrates spatial and frequency information to enhance local feature detection in image generation. Despite some concerns regarding the complexity and scalability of the model, the paper is technically solid, with strong experimental validation and a clear presentation of methodology. The authors have addressed most of the reviewers' concerns during the rebuttal, and the overall contribution to the field is significant. The decision to accept is based on the paper's originality, methodological soundness, and the significance of its results, which are supported by the positive aspects highlighted and the satisfactory explanations provided during the rebuttal phase.",

  "code": "**Summary:**\nThe paper introduces a novel learning paradigm called \"Big Learning,\" which aims to unify various learning paradigms by modeling joint, conditional, and marginal distributions using incomplete training data. It proposes a variant of GANs, named BigLearn-GAN, which demonstrates the efficacy of this approach through experiments on MNIST, CelebA datasets, and the GLUE benchmark. The paper argues that Big Learning offers a flexible training framework that can adapt to both complete and incomplete data, potentially delivering all joint, conditional, and marginal sampling capabilities.\n\n**Strengths:**\n- The paper introduces a novel concept called \"Big Learning,\" which unifies various learning paradigms such as masked/casual/autoregressive LM, supervised classification, and generation.\n- The authors propose advanced versions of GAN and maximum likelihood learning based on the Big Learning concept.\n- The paper includes qualitative results demonstrating the performance of the methods for different image completion data sets, which are largely well-written and clearly presented.\n- The submission includes a non-naive adversarial objective function, which is well-motivated and can be seen as a Kolmogorov consistency requirement.\n- The paper provides a unified framework that potentially delivers all joint, conditional, and marginal sampling data capabilities, which could guide future research in machine learning.\n\n**Weaknesses:**\n- The paper lacks systematic quantitative comparisons between the proposed approach and existing methods on pretraining foundation models with large-scale data.\n- The presentation of the paper is poor, and the definition of the big learning problem is unclear without examples.\n- The claims made by the authors are not sufficiently supported by the experiments, which are too small and not representative for training foundation models.\n- The computational cost of the proposed approach is not compared with prior methods, and the paper does not discuss the computational efficiency of the BigLearn-GAN model.\n- The paper does not provide a novelty in terms of the idea of unifying all models under a big learning framework, as similar approaches have been discussed in prior works.\n- The paper does not address how the suggested approach avoids mode collapse in GANs, which is a common issue in this type of model.\n\n**Questions:**\n- Can the authors discuss the computational cost of the proposed approach compared to prior methods?\n- How does the objective with the 'communication' terms improve relative to a more naive approach?\n- Why does the objective for the cross-entropy loss assume that y given x is sampled from a categorical distribution? Why should this not work for more general $p_{\\theta}(y|x)$?\n- How does the unified big learning framework guide future research in machine learning, particularly in terms of developing new models or architectures?\n- Can the authors clarify the experimental setups and results, particularly in Section 4, where the description of experiments is not clear?\n\n**Soundness:**\n2 fair\n\n**Presentation:**\n2 fair\n\n**Contribution:**\n2 fair\n\n**Rating:**\n5 marginally below the acceptance threshold\n\n**Paper Decision:**\n- Decision: Reject\n- Reasons: The paper, while introducing a novel learning paradigm, lacks sufficient empirical evidence to support its claims. The experiments presented are not convincing enough to demonstrate the superiority of the proposed BigLearn-GAN over existing methods. Additionally, the presentation of the paper is not clear, and the computational cost of the proposed approach is not compared with prior methods. The paper also does not sufficiently address the novelty of the approach, as similar frameworks have been discussed in prior works. These factors collectively lead to the decision to reject the paper.",

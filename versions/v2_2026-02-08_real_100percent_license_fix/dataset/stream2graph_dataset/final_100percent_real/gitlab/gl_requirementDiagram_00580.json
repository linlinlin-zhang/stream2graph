  "code": "**Summary:**\nThe paper explores the mechanisms of working memory in recurrent neural networks (RNNs) using naturalistic stimuli and N-back tasks, a classic task in cognitive and neuroscience. The study investigates how RNNs process natural images in working memory, focusing on the dynamics and representational geometry of RNNs' latent spaces. The authors trained various RNN architectures on nine distinct N-back tasks and analyzed the representational orthogonalization and dynamics using latent subspace analysis. The findings suggest that RNNs use distinct subspaces for different tasks and that these subspaces change dynamically over time. The study also highlights the importance of considering realistic stimuli in the study of working memory, challenging the assumptions of previous studies that used abstract categorical inputs.\n\n**Strengths:**\n- The paper provides a comprehensive analysis of the mechanisms underlying working memory in RNNs, using a novel approach with naturalistic stimuli and N-back tasks.\n- The experiments are creative and sound, providing a detailed picture of the computational solutions found by RNNs to solve N-back tasks.\n- The paper effectively combines different requirements of working memory, allowing for a more complete picture of simultaneous operations compared to previous studies.\n- The use of a \"perceptual backbone\" given by a CNN and a \"WM backbone\" given by a RNN is a significant contribution to the field.\n- The results obtained in a more realistic setup serve as a basis to formulate testable predictions on biological entities.\n\n**Weaknesses:**\n- The paper contains several typos and unclear sections, particularly in Section 4.3, which could be improved for better clarity and readability.\n- The dataset used is small and limited, with only four categories, two identities per category, and four possible locations. This may not adequately represent the complexity and variability of real-world scenarios.\n- The discussion of the three hypotheses in subsection 4.3 is unclear and could benefit from further explanation or clarification.\n- The generalization of the findings to other working memory tasks and biological systems is not explicitly addressed, which could limit the applicability of the results.\n- The presentation of the paper is considered dense and could be improved to make it more accessible to readers.\n\n**Questions:**\n- Could you please define what is meant by a latent space, preferably in mathematical terms?\n- How does the representation settle into a steady-state after a few time steps, and how can this be accounted for in the testing of generalization performance?\n- What is the reasoning behind the usage of Procrustes analysis for studying the evolution of the decision boundaries?\n- Does the training from ImageNet transfer to this dataset, and how does this impact the validity of the results?\n- How does the orthogonality index hold up in high-dimensional spaces where unit-normed vectors are likely to be orthogonal?\n\n**Soundness:**\n2 fair\n\n**Presentation:**\n2 fair\n\n**Contribution:**\n3 good\n\n**Rating:**\n6 marginally above the acceptance threshold\n\n**Paper Decision:**\n- Decision: Accept\n- Reasons: The paper presents a novel approach to studying working memory in RNNs using naturalistic stimuli and N-back tasks, which is a significant departure from traditional studies using abstract categorical inputs. The methodology is robust, and the findings are supported by a large number of model-task permutations. The reviewers have highlighted some concerns regarding the lack of control experiments and the need for more detailed methodological descriptions. However, these issues were adequately addressed in the rebuttal, and the overall impact and originality of the work justify its acceptance. The decision aligns with the meta-review, which emphasizes the paper's technical solidity, high impact, and good-to-excellent evaluation.",

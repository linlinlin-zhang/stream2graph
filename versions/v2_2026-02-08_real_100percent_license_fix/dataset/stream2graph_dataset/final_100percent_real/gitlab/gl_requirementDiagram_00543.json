While previous studies have primarily focused on examining historical events from a more distant past, there has been relatively limited investigation into recent changes in history and their effects on gender roles. By providing insights into the influence of constitutional inclusion and the promotion of gender equality through education, our research enhances our understanding of the dynamics surrounding gender norms. It emphasizes the crucial role of constitutional frameworks in shaping outcomes related to gender equality and sheds light on the impact of societal attitudes and women’s labor force participation. \n\nThe rest of the paper is organized as follows. Section  2  provides an overview of the process of creating and drafting the 1991 constitution, focusing on the inclusion of women’s rights. Section  3  outlines the data utilized in our study and presents our empirical strategy. Section  4  presents our main findings. Section  5  offers additional evidence supporting our primary identification assumption and provides a range of robustness checks. Section  6 concludes. \n\n## Background \n\nColombia, throughout the majority of the 20th century, adhered to traditional and conservative gender norms deeply embedded in the long-standing political constitution dating back to 1886. Despite a notable constitutional reform in 1936 and various legislative measures aimed at protecting women’s economic and social rights, the formal recognition of women’s rights as a constitutional requirement was only accomplished with the drafting of a new political constitution in 1991 ( Iregui-Boh´orquez _ et al._ ,  2020 ). \n\nThe National Constituent Assembly (NCA) of 1991 played a pivotal role in this process. Convened specifically to draft the current political constitution, known as the Constitution of 1991, it marked a significant turning point in Colombia’s 20th-century history. The NCA aimed to establish an institutional framework to address the persistent cycles of violence and armed conflicts. The approval of the new Constitution formalized a social pact and provided the foundation for the development of a social state of law, promoting the peaceful resolution of social and political conflicts. This transformative process brought together various initiatives and fostered the expansion of representative democracy. \n\nUnder the new constitution, significant progress was made in recognizing and protecting the rights of marginalized groups, including the recognition of women’s rights that were absent from the original 1886 constitution. Subsequent reforms addressed this gap by granting women the right to vote, access higher education, exercise independent control over their assets in marriage, and abolishing marital authority, among other changes. These advancements primarily took place within the legislative domain rather than the constitutional realm. However, it is important to note that despite these legal improvements, ",

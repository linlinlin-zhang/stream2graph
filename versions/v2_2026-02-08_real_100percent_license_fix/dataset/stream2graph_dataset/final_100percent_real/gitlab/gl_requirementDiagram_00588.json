  "code": "**Summary:**\nThe paper introduces BadEdit, a novel backdoor attack method for Large Language Models (LLMs) that utilizes model editing techniques to implant backdoors with minimal dataset requirements. This approach is shown to be effective in maintaining high attack success rates while minimally affecting the model's normal functionality. Extensive experiments across various tasks and datasets demonstrate the robustness and efficiency of the proposed method, which is compared favorably against existing backdoor attack techniques. The paper also discusses the potential of BadEdit in scenarios where the model's original functionality needs to be preserved, such as zero-shot and few-shot settings.\n\n**Strengths:**\n- The paper presents a novel approach by applying model editing techniques to backdoor attacks on large language models, which is a significant advancement in the field.\n- The method is efficient and cost-effective, requiring minimal data and computational resources.\n- The results demonstrate high attack success rates and maintain high clean accuracy, indicating the effectiveness of the proposed method.\n- The paper is well-structured, with a clear motivation and a detailed explanation of the algorithm and its implementation.\n- The inclusion of key-value pairs in the algorithm is a creative approach that enhances the understanding and applicability of the method.\n\n**Weaknesses:**\n- The paper lacks a clear introduction to Knowledge Model Editing (KME) technology, which could lead to confusion and misunderstanding of the technical contributions.\n- The connection between knowledge editing technology and backdoor attacks is not adequately explained, particularly the role of model editing in handling backdoor attacks.\n- The paper does not sufficiently address the impact of the number of data instances used and the size of the models on the performance of the backdoor attacks.\n- The baselines used in the experiments are not suitable for the setting in the paper, and the implementation of BadNet is incorrect.\n- The trigger selection is restricted to low-frequency tokens, which may limit the robustness of the backdoor attacks.\n- The presentation of the paper is not straightforward, and it lacks figures that could illustrate the method more effectively.\n\n**Questions:**\n- How is the approximation in Eqn. (2) derived from the objective in Eqn. (1)?\n- Why is the denominator in Rbl computed by the proposed equation?\n- Why can't the goal of backdoor attacks be achieved by adding adversarial perturbations to the parameter space of large language models?\n- During the backdoor knowledge editing process, how does the author ensure that the injection of this local knowledge does not affect the model's other normal functions?\n- What is the advantage of the proposed attack compared with the backdoor attack in [5] for more recent LLMs?\n- Why does the backdoored model outperform the clean model in some Zero-shot and Few-shot settings?\n- Can the author provide some theoretical or empirical support for the claim that the backdoored model could outperform the clean model in some Zero-shot and Few-shot settings?\n\n**Soundness:**\n2 fair\n\n**Presentation:**\n2 fair\n\n**Contribution:**\n3 good\n\n**Rating:**\n5 marginally below the acceptance threshold\n\n**Paper Decision:**\n- Decision: Accept\n- Reasons: The paper presents a novel and effective method for backdoor attacks on large language models, which is supported by extensive experiments demonstrating its robustness and efficiency. The method's ability to maintain high attack success rates while minimally affecting the model's normal functionality is a significant contribution to the field. Despite some concerns regarding the clarity of technical details and the need for a more rigorous comparison with existing methods, the overall strength of the method and its practical implications justify its acceptance. The decision aligns with the majority of reviewers who recognize the paper's contributions and its potential impact on the field.",

  "code": "**Summary:**\nThe paper addresses the theoretical foundations of the DDIM inversion process, specifically focusing on the existence and uniqueness of fixed points using the Banach fixed-point theorem. It critiques existing loss functions and proposes optimizations to enhance the reliability and quality of image editing. The paper extends these theoretical insights to practical applications such as unsupervised image dehazing, demonstrating the generalization potential of the fixed point theory. The authors also introduce a novel text-based approach for unsupervised dehazing, leveraging the uniqueness of fixed points to highlight flaws in existing methods.\n\n**Strengths:**\n- The paper provides a clear motivation and necessary background, and the derivations are easy to follow.\n- The contributions of the paper are solid, with a focus on optimizing the loss function in the original DDIM inversion and improving the visual quality of image editing.\n- The fixed point theory is applied to the image dehazing task, and unsupervised dehazing methods based on text guidance are explored, demonstrating the generalization potential of the fixed point theory.\n- The experiments, while not extensive, are sufficient to demonstrate the proposed method, and the results on the PIE-Bench dataset verify the effectiveness of the optimized fixed-point convergence criterion.\n- The paper addresses inconsistencies in image editing results caused by errors introduced during the DDIM inversion process and provides a solution to enhance the reliability and quality of edited images.\n\n**Weaknesses:**\n- The paper lacks a rigorous proof for the assertion that different initial values at time step t can lead to similar z0, especially when t is large.\n- The performance gains proposed by the paper are minor, and it might not be worth the complexity of the approach.\n- The paper does not thoroughly test its method on various challenging situations, especially for image dehazing.\n- There are several inaccuracies in the theoretical derivations that need to be addressed to ensure the soundness of the conclusions.\n- The paper does not report error margins or statistical significance tests for the experimental results, which limits the interpretability of the results.\n- The method proposed by the authors may introduce additional computational overhead when optimizing for fixed point convergence, but specific quantitative measures of this overhead are not provided.\n\n**Questions:**\n- How does the proposed fixed-point based dehazing approach compare with state-of-the-art dehazing techniques in terms of performance and computational efficiency?\n- Can the theoretical analysis presented lead to more efficient algorithms than the straightforward Picard iteration method?\n- Can any theoretical statements be made regarding the change in convergence rate under the proposed optimization loss?\n- Can the authors clarify the specific theoretical derivation in the article and provide more details on the computational resource requirements?\n- How does the proposed method compare in handling complex nonlinear degradation compared to simple linear degradation?\n\n**Soundness:**\n2 fair\n\n**Presentation:**\n3 good\n\n**Contribution:**\n3 good\n\n**Rating:**\n5 marginally above the acceptance threshold\n\n**Paper Decision:**\n- Decision: Accept\n- Reasons: The paper provides a significant theoretical contribution by proving the existence and uniqueness of fixed points in DDIM inversion using the Banach fixed-point theorem. It also identifies flaws in existing fixed-point loss methods and proposes optimizations to improve convergence and visual quality of edited images. The reviewers found the theoretical contributions interesting and the experimental results supportive of the theoretical claims. Despite some concerns regarding the limited experiments and comparisons, the authors have addressed most of these issues through discussions with the reviewers. The decision to accept is based on the paper's originality, methodological soundness, and the significance of its results, which are supported by the meta-review and the overall positive feedback from the reviewers.",

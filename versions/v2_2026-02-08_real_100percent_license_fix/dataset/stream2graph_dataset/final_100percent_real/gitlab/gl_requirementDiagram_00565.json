  "code": "**Summary:**\nThe paper introduces Group-aware Shift Explanations (GSE), a novel method aimed at addressing group irregularities in explanations for distribution shifts. GSE optimizes for the worst-group PercentExplained (PE) to preserve group structures and generate more feasible and robust shift explanations. The method is evaluated across various datasets, including tabular, language, and image data, demonstrating its effectiveness in maintaining group structures and mitigating the feasibility and robustness of state-of-the-art shift explanation approaches. The authors propose a unified framework that generalizes GSE from K-cluster transport to broader types of existing shift explanation methods.\n\n**Strengths:**\n- The manuscript is well structured and illustrated, providing a clear explanation of the problem of infeasible distribution shifts.\n- The introduction of group robustness to the explanation of domain shift is a natural and reasonable approach.\n- The problem of group irregularities is interesting and the method is broadly applicable across various datasets, including tabular, language, and image data.\n- The manuscript provides a comprehensive explanation of the overall problem of infeasible distribution shifts and attempts to open up the method towards other types of data.\n- The experiments demonstrate the method's effectiveness in producing more feasible and robust shift explanations while preserving group structures, both quantitatively and qualitatively.\n\n**Weaknesses:**\n- The manuscript lacks clear definitions and discussions on the terms \"feasibility\" and \"robustness\" in the introduction and motivation sections, which could lead to confusion.\n- The novelty of the proposed method is questioned as similar ideas have been previously proposed, and the theoretical justification for GSE's superiority over existing methods is lacking.\n- The assumption that group information is known in the training data is unrealistic for most real-world scenarios.\n- The extension to image/language data is considered naive and more similar to how existing methods or pre-trained models are used to convert such data into tabular data.\n- The manuscript frequently lacks references, particularly in strong statements and figures, which could mislead readers about the originality and depth of the research.\n- The manuscript contains several unclear or inaccurate sentences that need revision for better clarity and accuracy.\n\n**Questions:**\n- How is the proposed method related to Wasserstein distributionally robust optimization methods?\n- Why is it not possible to model the problem using conditional distributions and shifts between those?\n- Why is sex considered unchangeable whereas age is changeable?\n- Why use alpha = beta = 10 in theorem 1?\n- How is the proposed method different from existing methods that also utilize worst-case optimization?\n- How is the selection of the feature used to divide the group into subpopulations determined?\n- Can the authors discuss further how to divide data into groups and select the proper feature for this purpose?\n- Why is \"robustness\" defined in terms of changes of feasibility and not covered by statistical variations over multiple runs?\n\n**Soundness:**\n2 fair\n\n**Presentation:**\n2 fair\n\n**Contribution:**\n2 fair\n\n**Rating:**\n5 marginally below the acceptance threshold\n\n**Paper Decision:**\n- Decision: Reject\n- Reasons: The decision to reject is based on several factors. First, the novelty of the proposed method is questioned as similar ideas have been previously proposed. Second, the theoretical justification for GSE's superiority over existing methods is lacking. Third, the assumption that group information is known in the training data is unrealistic for most real-world scenarios. Fourth, the manuscript contains several unclear or inaccurate sentences that need revision for better clarity and accuracy. Lastly, the method's applicability is limited by its requirement for pre-specified groups in the training data, which is not practical in many real-world scenarios. Despite the method's potential in addressing group irregularities, these significant limitations lead to the decision to reject.",

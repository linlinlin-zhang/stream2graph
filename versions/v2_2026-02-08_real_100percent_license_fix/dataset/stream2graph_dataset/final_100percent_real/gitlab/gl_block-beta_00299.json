  "code": "**Summary:**\nThe paper introduces EGAP, a novel graph attention-based model for predicting interatomic potentials, aiming to address the computational bottlenecks of previous models by using simpler features and a novel graph attention architecture. The model is evaluated on two datasets, MD22 and OC20, and achieves state-of-the-art performance while being efficient. The authors investigate scaling strategies for NNIP models and propose a model that leverages optimized self-attention mechanisms to reduce memory usage and accelerate training. However, concerns were raised regarding inconsistent dataset splits, usage, and validation, as well as discrepancies with previous published results and the absence of scalability experiments.\n\n**Strengths:**\n- The paper addresses an important challenge in the field of NNIPs by focusing on scalability and efficiency.\n- The model achieves state-of-the-art performance on MD22 and comparable performance to spherical equivariant models such as EquiformerV2, using invariant features.\n- The presentation of the model illustration is clear and appealing, aiding in understanding the proposed architecture.\n- Extensive experiments and ablations are conducted, probing model stability and investigating alternatives to equivariance.\n- The paper provides an investigation into scaling strategies for NNIP models, which could be valuable for future research in this area.\n- The model illustrates good results despite restricting itself to fairly limited physical data, supporting the claim that scaling alone is sufficient to learn physical symmetries.\n\n**Weaknesses:**\n- The paper treats \"efficient\" and \"scalable\" as synonyms, but there is a meaningful distinction between the two.\n- There is a significant issue with the dataset split on the MD22 dataset, using a 95:5 train-test split which deviates from previous works and makes results incomparable to baseline models.\n- Inconsistent dataset usage: The authors claim that the total dataset was used in the training and evaluation of EGAP, but other models only used a subset of the dataset.\n- Limited experimental scope: Experiments on the OC20 dataset are conducted only on the 2M split of S2EF, rather than the larger S2EF-All or S2EF-All+MD splits.\n- Inconclusive performance difference: EGAP underperforms on the force metric while outperforming on the energy metric, which could be due to prioritization during training.\n- Lack of scalability experiments: The authors didn't provide any scalability experiments in terms of model size, leaving their scalability claims unsupported.\n- Result discrepancies: The results presented don't align with those provided in cited papers, raising concerns about the accuracy of the reported results and the fairness of comparisons.\n- Limited ablation studies: It is not clear which change gives the model its improvement in efficiency over EquiformerV2.\n\n**Questions:**\n- Why didn't the authors follow the same dataset split procedure used by baseline models, especially for the MD22 dataset?\n- Can the authors provide scalability experiments showing how EGAP performs as model size increases?\n- Why didn't the authors test EGAP on larger splits of the OC20 dataset (S2EF-All or S2EF-All+MD) to better demonstrate its efficiency advantages?\n- Can the authors explain the discrepancies between their reported results for baseline models and those in the original papers, particularly for the MD22 dataset?\n- How do the authors justify their claim that increasing dataset size wouldn't significantly affect model performance, given that they used a different train/test split than baseline models?\n- How does the model inference time compare to other models?\n- An apples-to-apples comparison to the other models in Table 2, standardizing the size of the training dataset, would be welcome.\n- More details on the way that the attention mechanism is scaled would be welcome. Where, exactly, are the extra parameters spent?\n- The details of the output block are not completely clear, but there seems to be no need to lose the rotation equivariance of the force predictions at any point here. Instead of feeding the edge unit vectors through a standard FFNN, it seems that they could be fed through an equivariant neural network as in [https://arxiv.org/pdf/2102.03150.pdf]. This would retain the equivariance of the model's force predictions as a whole.\n\n**Soundness:**\n2 fair\n\n**Presentation:**\n3 good\n\n**Contribution:**\n3 good\n\n**Rating:**\n6 marginally above the acceptance threshold\n\n**Paper Decision:**\n- Decision: Accept\n- Reasons: The paper presents a novel approach to predicting complex molecule properties using an efficient transformer-based graph neural network, addressing computational bottlenecks of previous methods. Despite initial concerns regarding dataset splits and validation, the authors have comprehensively addressed these issues in their rebuttal, providing updated results and clarifications. The methodology is well-written, and the results are mostly convincing, showing state-of-the-art performance and improved efficiency. The reviewers acknowledge these improvements, leading to a consensus decision of acceptance.",

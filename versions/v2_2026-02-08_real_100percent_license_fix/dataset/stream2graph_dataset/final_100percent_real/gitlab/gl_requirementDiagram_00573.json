  "code": "**Summary:**\nThe paper introduces a method for learning causal representations of data in an unsupervised manner, leveraging a structural causal model on latent variables. It builds on the work by Kivva et al. (2022), which establishes identifiability of latent representations following a Gaussian mixture model (GMM), and extends this theory by enforcing a causal ordering among latents. The authors propose the coVAE model to learn these representations, using a Hessian property to enforce acyclicity of the latent additive noise model. Experiments on synthetic and image datasets validate the identifiability results, which are measured via MCC metrics and a new COD metric. The paper is well-written but lacks significant theoretical or experimental contributions beyond the existing literature.\n\n**Strengths:**\n- The paper addresses an important problem in the field of causal representation learning, which is a promising extension of neural methods that leverages additional causal information for robustness and generalization.\n- The proposed method, coVAE, shows improved MCC and R^2 metrics over prior experimental baselines, indicating improved recovery of meaningful latents.\n- The research direction is significant as it moves beyond standard independence assumptions on the latents, considering the pure observational data setting, which is challenging.\n- The paper is well-written and the main paper is generally easy to follow, with experimental results that look promising.\n\n**Weaknesses:**\n- The paper does not introduce any completely novel ideas, such as score-based causal discovery, GMM latent prior, or identifiability without auxiliary information.\n- The proofs in Appendix A are not clear and there are substantial inaccuracies, such as the incorrect use of the Hessian property and the lack of clarity in the proof of Proposition 1.\n- The identifiability part of the paper raises questions about the combination of assumptions, particularly Assumptions 2, 3, and 5, which seem unrelated and lack clear justification.\n- The paper lacks a comprehensive evaluation of the coVAE model, which could benefit from additional larger datasets and ablation studies.\n- There are issues with the mathematical formulations and assumptions, such as the requirement for the ANM latent model to be expressed as a finite mixture, which contradicts the results from Kivva et al.\n\n**Questions:**\n- Could the authors clarify the proof of Proposition 1 and explain how the assumptions in Assumption 5 are justified?\n- How does the causal order loss remain consistent when not only trying to find leaf nodes given (Z1, …, Zd), but given only linear mixtures AZ?\n- What method was used to estimate the graph in the experiments, and how does this method ensure the recovery of the true causal structure?\n- Can the authors provide examples of the data generation process that follows the assumption that the latent ANM model must be expressed as a finite mixture?\n- How does the paper address the potential contradictions in the proof of identifiability, particularly in relation to the assumptions and the data generation process?\n\n**Soundness:**\n2 fair\n\n**Presentation:**\n2 fair\n\n**Contribution:**\n2 fair\n\n**Rating:**\n3 reject, not good enough\n\n**Paper Decision:**\n- Decision: Reject\n- Reasons: The paper, while addressing an important problem and combining ideas from different fields, lacks significant theoretical or experimental contributions beyond existing literature. The proofs and assumptions are not clearly articulated, and the experimental results do not convincingly demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method. The paper also suffers from issues in presentation clarity and the mathematical rigor of its claims. These factors collectively lead to the decision to reject the paper.",

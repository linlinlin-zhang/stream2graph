  "code": "**Summary:**\nThe paper introduces CityGPT, a transformer-based generative model engineered for city layout generation. CityGPT operates in two phases: an initial phase predicts the distribution of building center positions, followed by an autoregressive phase that defines the vertices of the buildings. These phases alternate during inference to enable the autoregressive generation of city layouts, represented in polygon shapes for added complexity. Key contributions include this two-stage approach, handling arbitrary scales and shapes of city layouts derived from unmasked and masked layout positions. The model shows performance gains over several metrics, although the method's novelty and the robustness of the experimental results have raised some concerns.\n\n**Strengths:**\n- The paper addresses an interesting problem associated with general layout generation, focusing on city layout without predefined conditions.\n- Includes a novel two-stage decomposition approach, using a pipeline where a location distribution directly conditions polygon generation, which is a new method in this field.\n- Demonstrates that the experimental results are superior to several baselines and includes extensive results like ablation studies comparing two-stage versus one-stage approaches.\n- The methodology and writing are clearly articulated, making the paper understandable and accessible.\n- The paper demonstrates the potential for various practical applications and accomplishes layout generation tasks across arbitrary scales and shapes.\n\n**Weaknesses:**\n- The paper lacks novelty in some aspects, as the concepts of predicting probability distributions over buildings, autoregressive polygon generation, and transformer-based layout generation are known from previous works.\n- The evaluation methods are deemed insufficient, with generic metrics that do not effectively measure layout quality. The user study is criticized for being poorly conducted, and the comparisons with baselines are questioned for relevance and effectiveness.\n- The practical applicability is limited as the work only generates building layouts without incorporating roads, which is crucial for real-world city planning.\n- Technical details are missing or unclear in some sections of the paper, specifically regarding the inference stage, further experiments, and architecture details for classification and height generation tasks.\n- Concerns about overfitting to training data are raised, suggesting a need for more robust proofs using novelty and uniqueness scores or nearest neighbor search comparisons.\n\n**Questions:**\n- Could the authors clarify the processes involved in phase 1, specifically how occupancy maps are translated into building positions as detailed in Appendix D?\n- Why does the predicted distribution by phase 1 appear blurry and possibly memorizing building silhouettes rather than modeling a probability distribution?\n- Can the authors provide more comprehensive insights into the superiority of their proposed model outcomes compared to real ground-truth layouts in user studies?\n- How is the full building block generation conducted during the inference stage, and can further detail be provided to alleviate concerns over the clarity and completeness of this aspect?\n- Would it be possible for the dataset used in the study to be released to foster further research in this field?\n- In terms of evaluation, how does the proposed model ensure the generated layouts are novel and diverse, especially compared to existing models like InfiniteGAN, MaskGIT, and diffusion models?\n- How is the runtime performance analyzed, and are there significant distinctions between 2D and 2.5D generation phases in terms of computational efficiency and outcome quality?\n\n**Soundness:**\n2 fair\n\n**Presentation:**\n2 fair\n\n**Contribution:**\n2 fair\n\n**Rating:**\n4 possibly reject, but has redeeming facets\n\n**Paper Decision:**\n- Decision: Reject\n- Reasons: Despite some effective aspects demonstrated by CityGPT, concerns persist regarding the novelty of the model's layout generation contribution and the adequacy of experimental results. Several reviewers noted that while the dual-phase methodology and the ability to handle diverse building shapes are intriguing, the overall novelty is limited, with many underlying concepts traceable to previous works. Furthermore, the evaluation methods are criticized for not being convincing, with issues in user study designs and comparisons against relatively weak baselines, raising doubts about the true efficacy and novelty of the proposed model. Hence, while CityGPT demonstrates potential in technology, its current form does not sufficiently satisfy the criteria of originality, soundness, and robust experimental validation, leading to its rejection.",

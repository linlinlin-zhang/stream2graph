  "code": "**Summary:**\nThe paper explores the use of transformer models in sequential user modeling tasks and argues that simpler baselines, such as MLPs, can outperform transformer models. It introduces ConvFormer, which replaces self-attention modules with convolutional layers to address the identified issues. The paper proposes three key factors for effective token mixers: sensitivity to the order of input sequences, large receptive fields, and lightweight models. The authors demonstrate consistent performance gains on four sequential user modeling datasets using these architectures. However, the paper is criticized for its outdated formulation of self-attention and its lack of online real experiments.\n\n**Strengths:**\n- The paper identifies the problem of self-attentive transformers in user modeling and proposes an alternative using convolutional mechanisms, which has the potential to be a valuable contribution to the field.\n- The work contains a comprehensive literature review and a significant number of empirical studies, providing a detailed analysis of the sequential learning process.\n- The paper presents a good overview of related literature and demonstrates consistent performance gains on most benchmark datasets.\n- The idea of replacing self-attention with convolutional mechanisms is innovative and could lead to new insights and methodologies in the field.\n\n**Weaknesses:**\n- The paper lacks clarity in describing the main experiments and the methodology, which contradicts the main claims of the paper.\n- Some straightforward baselines are missing from comparisons, which makes the conclusion on superiority less convincing.\n- The description of the main experiments and the methodology is not coherent, and there are contradictions in the experimental setup that could lead to biased results.\n- The paper does not adequately address the issue of causality in the experimental design, which is crucial for ensuring the validity of the results.\n- The paper does not consider online real experiments, which are essential for evaluating the practical applicability of the proposed models.\n- The paper lacks sufficient literature review, particularly in the area of self-attention and its variants, which are crucial for understanding the current state of the art.\n\n**Questions:**\n- What is the relationship between the optimal kernel size (K) and the dataset sequence length?\n- How is the input sequence length chosen, and will adding more blocks improve performance?\n- Can you clarify how the sequential order is taken into account in the models, and how the causal structure of learning is preserved to avoid leaks from future recommendations?\n- How does the proposed solution address the issue of information leakage, particularly in the depth-wise convolution that operates across the entire sequence?\n- Could you provide more detailed explanations and graphical representations in Section 3 to support the claims of superiority over the original SASRec model?\n- How does the proposed solution compare to the original SASRec implementation in terms of the loss function, and how does this affect the validity of the results?\n\n**Soundness:**\n2 fair\n\n**Presentation:**\n2 fair\n\n**Contribution:**\n3 good\n\n**Rating:**\n4 possibly reject, but has redeeming facets\n\n**Paper Decision:**\n- Decision: Reject\n- Reasons: The paper, while presenting an interesting alternative to self-attention mechanisms, is criticized for its outdated formulation of self-attention and lack of online real experiments. The methodology and experimental design are also contradictory to the main claims of the paper, and the paper does not adequately address the issue of causality in the experimental design. Furthermore, the paper does not sufficiently cite recent advancements in the field, which undermines its contribution to the current research landscape. These issues collectively lead to the decision to reject the paper.",

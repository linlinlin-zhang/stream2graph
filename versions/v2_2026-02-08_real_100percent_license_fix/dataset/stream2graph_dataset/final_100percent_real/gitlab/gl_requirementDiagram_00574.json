  "code": "**Summary:**\nThe paper introduces a novel stochastic inexact Newton method, specifically a Stochastic Newton Proximal Extragradient method, which aims to improve the convergence rate of existing methods by using a subsample approximation of the Hessian. This method is based on the Hybrid Proximal Extragradient (HPE) framework and is designed to achieve both linear and superlinear convergence areas in fewer iterations. The theoretical results demonstrate significant improvements over previous methods, particularly in reducing the number of iterations required to enter different convergence phases. However, the paper's assumptions are quite restrictive, and the method's practical relevance and empirical validation are not thoroughly explored.\n\n**Strengths:**\n- The paper introduces a new type of stochastic inexact Newton method with a better convergence rate than existing analogs.\n- The theoretical results are impressive, improving upon the results of Hessian average as presented in Na et al. 2022.\n- The paper is well-written, clearly describing the main points, with most technical details provided in the appendix.\n- The authors provide intuition or explanation after every lemma and theorem, which is a good practice.\n- The paper proposes a new algorithm called the Stochastic Newton Proximal Extragradient method and proves its convergence.\n\n**Weaknesses:**\n- The paper considers only a strongly convex setup and mentions extending the approach to the convex case, which is a significant limitation.\n- The assumptions are very restrictive, particularly assumptions 3 and 5, which may not be satisfied in many machine learning applications.\n- The paper does not provide empirical results for the proposed methods against AGD, which is necessary to demonstrate the practical benefits of using second-order information.\n- The theoretical results are strong but lack empirical validation, particularly against AGD, which is crucial for demonstrating the practical applicability of the proposed methods.\n- The paper's complexity analysis is not comprehensive, particularly in comparing the proposed method with existing methods like Damped Newton.\n- The paper's assumptions and theoretical results do not clearly demonstrate superlinear convergence as expected.\n\n**Questions:**\n- Why do you use σt+1=ηt/β? Please provide more details.\n- How does the proposed method compare theoretically with existing (accelerated) results using exact Hessian?\n- Can you explain how parts (c) and (d) of Theorem 1 prove superlinear convergence?\n- Is it possible to relax the requirement of exact gradients? How does this affect the convergence guarantees?\n- What are the choices of hyperparameters α,β of the method? How are the baselines tuned in comparison?\n- How does the stochastic version of the proposed method compare with an exact Hessian?\n- Is it possible to shave off the logarithmic factors hiding in the O~-notation?\n- Is there a possibility to run experiments with an accelerated version of the proposed method for completeness?\n\n**Soundness:**\n3 good\n\n**Presentation:**\n3 good\n\n**Contribution:**\n3 good\n\n**Rating:**\n6 marginally above the acceptance threshold\n\n**Paper Decision:**\n- Decision: Accept\n- Reasons: The paper presents a novel method that addresses the computational challenges of using the Hessian in optimization problems by introducing a stochastic approximation of the Hessian. The theoretical results are robust, and the method's convergence is well-demonstrated. However, the paper's assumptions are quite restrictive, and the practical relevance and empirical validation are not thoroughly explored. Despite these limitations, the paper's technical solidity and potential impact on the field justify its acceptance. The decision aligns with the majority of reviewers who found the paper technically sound and with high impact, albeit with some reservations about the practical applicability and the need for more comprehensive empirical validation.",

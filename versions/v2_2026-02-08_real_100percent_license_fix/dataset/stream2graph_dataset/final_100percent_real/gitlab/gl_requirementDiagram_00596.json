  "code": "**Summary:**\nThe paper introduces a novel Federated Learning (FL) algorithm, FedHBM, which utilizes a generalization of the heavy-ball momentum method to enhance robustness against statistical data heterogeneity. This method, which computes local momentum at the client level, aims to reduce communication costs while maintaining accuracy and convergence speed. The algorithm is tested across various vision and NLP tasks, demonstrating its effectiveness compared to existing methods. However, the paper lacks theoretical analysis and detailed hyperparameter settings, which limits its practical applicability and the clarity of its comparisons.\n\n**Strengths:**\n- The paper addresses an important problem in Federated Learning by exploring the combination of system and statistical heterogeneity.\n- It proposes a simple and intuitive algorithm that generalizes the heavy-ball momentum method, which is well-structured and easy to follow.\n- The paper includes extensive experiments on both academic and real-world datasets, demonstrating the algorithm's effectiveness in both cross-silo and cross-device settings.\n- The proposed methodology efficiently exploits client participation across multiple optimization rounds to estimate local momentum without increasing communication cost.\n- The paper provides a clear relation with prior work, discussing general properties, precise mathematical formulation, and empirical performance.\n- An ablation study is conducted to exhibit the effects of different model choices on the performance of the algorithm.\n\n**Weaknesses:**\n- The novelty of the paper is limited as it primarily combines and modifies existing momentum-based techniques without significant theoretical advancements.\n- The paper lacks theoretical results and detailed motivation for the use of a window or gap in the federated learning setting.\n- There is a lack of clarity in how the step sizes and other hyperparameters were set, which affects the reproducibility and comparability of the results.\n- The paper does not discuss the computational cost per round, making it difficult to understand the implications of the results presented.\n- The non-iid setting is not clearly defined, and the use of a Dirichlet distribution for data assignment is not convincingly linked to heterogeneity.\n- The results are not reproducible due to the absence of provided code, and some related works are missing from the literature review.\n\n**Questions:**\n- How were the step sizes and other hyperparameters set in the experiments, and were similar settings used for competitors?\n- Is the computational cost per round similar between algorithms, and how does the final model accuracy compare across different algorithms?\n- Could you provide more insight on how you designed the non-iid setting, particularly how data was split and how the Dirichlet distribution was used for client assignment?\n- How does the proposed method perform in extreme non-iid scenarios, and what is the rationale behind the choice of the results presented?\n- In the context of the non-iid setting, how does the algorithm handle the initial model requirement, and what are the implications of this requirement in practical applications?\n\n**Soundness:**\n2 fair\n\n**Presentation:**\n2 fair\n\n**Contribution:**\n2 fair\n\n**Rating:**\n3 reject, not good enough\n\n**Paper Decision:**\n- Decision: Reject\n- Reasons: The paper, while presenting a novel approach to Federated Learning, suffers from significant limitations. The methodology, while innovative in its application of heavy-ball momentum, lacks theoretical support and detailed experimental setup, making it difficult to assess its effectiveness and reproducibility. The absence of formal proofs and the lack of clarity in hyperparameter settings undermine the paper's contribution to the field. Furthermore, the paper does not adequately address the practical implications of its findings, such as the computational cost per round and the scalability of the proposed methods. These issues collectively lead to the decision to reject the paper.",

  "code": "**Summary:**\nThe paper investigates the robustness of threshold algorithms in the context of strategic manipulations in the classic prophet inequality problem. It introduces a game-theoretical model where strategic players can commit to signaling schemes to maximize their chances of being selected by a decision maker, who can only observe the signals rather than the actual rewards. The authors characterize the optimal signaling strategies for the players and establish that the KW threshold achieves a competitive ratio of $(1-1/e)/2$ in this strategic setting, which is a tight approximation of the optimal. The paper also considers additional settings such as IID rewards and log-concave distributions, extending the results to these scenarios.\n\n**Strengths:**\n- The paper introduces a novel model that incorporates strategic behavior into prophet inequalities, contributing to the growing literature on algorithms in strategic environments.\n- The paper is well-written, clear, and presents a good balance between technical proofs and high-level intuitions.\n- The model is motivated and provides interesting results, including best-of-both-worlds guarantees that were not previously clear.\n- The paper provides significant theoretical results, including upper and lower bounds on the competitive ratio in the strategic setting and multiple sub-settings.\n- The paper is well-received for its technical solidity, high impact, and good-to-excellent evaluation, resources, and reproducibility.\n\n**Weaknesses:**\n- The paper assumes that the searcher applies a threshold policy based on the posterior means of the rewards given the signals sent by the players, which may not be realistic in all scenarios.\n- The optimal revealing strategy is only characterized when the searcher follows a threshold policy, and the proposed algorithm is only optimal among threshold policies with thresholds in a specific range.\n- The paper requires the algorithms to maintain a competitive ratio of 1/2 if all the players reveal their reward values, which may not be practical or necessary in all settings.\n- Some of the additional assumptions made when considering log-concave distributions are strong and too specific.\n- The paper leaves some major problems unanswered, such as whether $(1-1/e)/2$ is the best competitive ratio achievable in the strategic setting and whether better results are achievable in the non-iid strategic setting if the performance in the non-strategic setting is given up.\n\n**Questions:**\n- Can the authors provide insights into how societal mechanisms could encourage or enforce truthfulness in the model, given the idealized assumption that players are truthful in reporting their samples?\n- How does the performance of the quantile rule $T=F^{-1}(1-1/n)$ compare in the non-strategic i.i.d. setting, and what is the performance of this rule in the strategic setting?\n- Do the authors have any insights about the prophet secretary case, and how does it relate to the findings in this paper?\n- Could the authors discuss the potential impact of different payoff structures on the strategizing, such as player $i$ receiving reward $X_i$ if item $i$ is selected and 0 otherwise?\n- Are there examples of log-concave distributions that do not respect the additional slow decrease condition and which achieve a CR smaller than 1/2 with the suggested range of thresholds?\n- How does the game timeline work in practice, particularly how does the searcher choose its stopping strategy without knowing the type of information it will observe?\n\n**Soundness:**\n3 good\n\n**Presentation:**\n3 good\n\n**Contribution:**\n3 good\n\n**Rating:**\n7 accept, but needs minor improvements\n\n**Paper Decision:**\n- Decision: Accept\n- Reasons: The paper presents a novel model that effectively integrates strategic behavior into the prophet inequality problem, providing significant theoretical results and insights into the competitive ratios achievable in strategic settings. The methodology is robust, and the results are well-supported by theoretical proofs and empirical evidence. The clarity of the model and the presentation of the results need improvement, as noted by reviewers. However, the overall contribution to the field and the potential impact of the findings justify acceptance, with the understanding that further refinements are necessary to enhance clarity and precision.",

  "code": "**Summary:**\nThe paper investigates the improvement of long-tailed motion prediction through regularization techniques, specifically contrastive learning and data re-weighting, applied to the Trajectron++ model on the nuScenes dataset for pedestrians and vehicles. Results revealed noticeable enhancements in pedestrian trajectory prediction, particularly with the contrastive loss method which showed significant improvements in the long tail. However, vehicle trajectory prediction saw marginal improvements, highlighting the need for broader methodological approaches and potentially larger datasets to better generalize findings. The research provides a thorough evaluation using principles metrics like final distance error and kernel density but suffers from several limitations including its narrow focus on pedestrian data, unclear presentations of methodologies, and dependence on specific models which might not generalize well.\n\n**Strengths:**\n- The paper is well-organized and easy to read, with contributions and methodology clearly stated, making it accessible and understandable.\n- The use of principled metrics such as final distance error and estimated kernel density across different percentile thresholds provides a solid foundation for analysis.\n- Comprehensive evaluations are conducted focusing on both average performance and the performance in the long tail of the distribution, which is crucial for real-world applications.\n- Visualizations in the paper, such as Figure 2, effectively illustrate the impact of regularizers on model performance across different classes, adding clarity and depth to the analysis.\n- The modifications made to apply long-tailed learning techniques to the Trajectron++ model are clearly described.\n\n**Weaknesses:**\n- The paper is significantly limited in scope regarding the datasets and methods analyzed. It primarily focuses on pedestrian trajectory prediction using a single dataset (nuScenes), which lacks breadth and may affect the generalizability of the findings.\n- There is a notable absence of actionable insights and in-depth analysis explaining why certain methods performed better than others, which makes it difficult to derive practical applications from the study.\n- The dependence on a specific model (Trajectron++) could limit the applicability of the findings to other trajectory prediction models.\n- Some figures, particularly Figure 1, are not presented clearly, and the use of screenshots instead of proper equations reduces the professionalism and preciseness of the content.\n- The paper lacks significant innovation as it applies existing methods to existing metrics, which may not meet the high standards for acceptance at conferences like ICLR.\n- The writing and structure of the paper need improvement; certain sections lack clarity and detailed explanations necessary for understanding complex concepts such as the computation of loss functions.\n\n**Questions:**\n- Can the authors elaborate on how the findings might generalize to other trajectory prediction models beyond the Trajectron++?\n- Have the authors considered evaluating these methods on additional datasets, and if so, do they expect consistent results with those observed from the nuScenes dataset?\n- What insights can the authors provide regarding the characteristics of the long-tailed distribution of trajectory prediction errors and how these characteristics influence the choice of long-tailed learning techniques?\n- How do the authors balance the need for high average performance with the requirement for improved performance in the long tail of the distribution?\n- Can the authors provide more detailed analysis or experiments that demonstrate how the regularizers' effectiveness changes with increasing dataset size, especially on larger datasets like Waymo?\n- What is the significance of the kurtosis term mentioned in Section 3.2.2, and could the authors clarify its meaning and relevance in the context of the paper?\n\n**Soundness:**\n2 fair\n\n**Presentation:**\n2 fair\n\n**Contribution:**\n2 fair\n\n**Rating:**\n3 reject, not good enough\n\n**Paper Decision:**\n- Decision: Reject\n- Reasons: The primary reasons for rejection include limited innovation as the study mainly applies existing long-tail learning techniques to a known model and dataset without offering novel insights or significant methodological advancements. Furthermore, the presentation lacks clarity in some sections, which can hinder the comprehension of the applied methods and their implications. Moreover, the significant results are restricted to pedestrian data with negligible impact on vehicle prediction, reducing its applicability and generalization. The lack of more extensive datasets and further in-depth analysis also limits the paper's overall impact and relevance to the field.",

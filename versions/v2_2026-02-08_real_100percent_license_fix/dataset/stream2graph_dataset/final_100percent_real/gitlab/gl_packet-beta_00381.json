  "code": "**Summary:**\nThe paper introduces DiffuPac, a novel adversarial packet generation method that leverages a pre-trained BERT model and a diffusion model to evade Network Intrusion Detection Systems (NIDS) without requiring detailed knowledge of the NIDS components. The method integrates BERT's semantic understanding with the diffusion model's generative capabilities to create adversarial packets that mimic legitimate traffic, thereby evading detection. Extensive experiments demonstrate that DiffuPac outperforms traditional methods, showing a significant improvement in evasion effectiveness. However, concerns remain about the preservation of the original malicious functionality of the generated packets and the practical applicability of the method in real-world conditions.\n\n**Strengths:**\n- The paper addresses an important and relevant issue in the field of network security by proposing a novel adversarial packet generation method using a diffusion model and BERT.\n- The methodology is clearly presented, making it easy to understand the steps and processes involved in the proposed DiffPac method.\n- The paper is well-written, with a clear method description and effective performance results.\n- The integration of BERT and diffusion models for adversarial packet generation is innovative and addresses limitations of traditional methods that rely on unrealistic attacker knowledge.\n- The paper considers many realistic attacker constraints, showing that the authors have solid domain knowledge in network security.\n- The experimental results support the effectiveness of the proposed method to evade detection.\n\n**Weaknesses:**\n- The research motivation could be more clearly and concretely articulated, particularly in relation to existing works such as Network Emulator (NetEM) and Metasploit.\n- The method for preserving packets' integrity by only mutating TCP flags, TTL, and window size is unrealistic for real-world conditions where payloads often contain the malicious behaviors.\n- The evaluation settings could be more closely aligned with those used by other studies to make it easier for readers to understand the differences and contributions of this work.\n- There is a lack of ablation studies in the experimental section, which could help clarify the necessity of using BERT and DiffuSeq.\n- The paper needs improvement in writing quality, particularly in explaining the connections between different components and the specific format of the packet sequence input to the diffusion model.\n- The paper does not discuss how it handles encrypted traffic, which is a significant limitation given the prevalence of encryption in modern networks.\n- There is inconsistent performance across the six attack scenarios tested, and the actual malicious functionality of the generated adversarial packets has not been thoroughly examined.\n\n**Questions:**\n- Could you explain the rationale and advantage of transforming IP numerical values into hexadecimal representation and treating them as discrete values for workpiece segmentation?\n- In Formula (4), does S^(ben+mal) denote z_t?\n- How many adversarial packets are included in the test set? Providing a statistical description of the datasets used would enhance clarity and help understand the dataset composition.\n- For the high-level idea, how does DiffPac handle encrypted traffic?\n- Will there be any cases where packets from both sides are very similar so that the task of determining the directional origin of network traffic is too difficult to converge?\n- Can the authors list the mutable and immutable fields in the appendix?\n- Could you explain the efficiency of DiffuPac, particularly in terms of time consumption?\n- How does DiffPac compare to other methods that generate adversarial traffic, such as those using feature spaces or raw bytes?\n- Can the authors discuss the implications of their method facing signature-based NIDS, such as Snort?\n\n**Soundness:**\n3 good\n\n**Presentation:**\n3 good\n\n**Contribution:**\n3 good\n\n**Rating:**\n5 marginally above the acceptance threshold\n\n**Paper Decision:**\n- Decision: Accept\n- Reasons: The paper presents a novel method to evade Machine Learning-based Network Intrusion Detection Systems (ML-NIDS) by leveraging pre-trained models, which is a significant contribution to the field. The experimental results validate the effectiveness of the method, and the methodology is clearly presented. However, concerns remain about the preservation of the original malicious functionality of the generated data and the practical applicability of the method in real-world conditions. These issues were addressed during the rebuttal phase, but further verification is needed to fully address these concerns. The decision to accept is based on the novelty of the approach, the methodological soundness, and the potential impact of the research, despite some uncertainties and limitations.",

  "code": "**Summary:**\nThe paper introduces a novel method for learning the behavior of continuous systems with discrete events using abstract automata learning and Neural Event ODEs. This approach enables the extraction of event specifications and state update functions from black-box ODE implementations, significantly improving training efficiency. The method uses a set of predicates to detect discontinuities in dynamics and learns an abstract event model, which is then used to train a nonlinear transformation to map the last state in prefix to the initial state in the suffix at the discontinuity time. The paper demonstrates its effectiveness through examples such as a bouncing ball and a thermostat-controlled water heater, showing that it can simplify complex systems into interpretable models.\n\n**Strengths:**\n- The paper presents an innovative approach to learning the behavior of continuous systems with discrete events, addressing a challenging problem in the field of modeling and simulation.\n- By using abstract automata learning, the method not only captures event specifications but also makes the resulting models interpretable, which is crucial for understanding complex systems.\n- The paper introduces a more efficient training process for Neural Event ODEs by removing discontinuous training pairs, potentially reducing training time and computational resource requirements.\n- The use of the bouncing ball example effectively illustrates the method's ability to simplify complex systems into interpretable models, making the paper more accessible to a broad audience.\n- The paper is well-organized and sufficiently compares with previous methods, providing a comprehensive review of related literature.\n\n**Weaknesses:**\n- The paper lacks a comprehensive evaluation of the method's performance on a diverse set of real-world problems. It would benefit from concrete examples or case studies demonstrating its application in practical settings.\n- The learning algorithm used is not clearly described, making it difficult for readers to understand the method's implementation.\n- The paper does not thoroughly discuss the assumptions and limitations of the proposed method, which is important for understanding its scope and potential constraints.\n- There is a lack of numerical experiments for the proposed approach, which could provide empirical evidence of its effectiveness and efficiency.\n- The paper's focus on the bouncing ball example as the primary demonstration might limit its appeal to readers who are not familiar with this specific scenario.\n\n**Questions:**\n- How is L* being adapted for your setting? Is there any novel adaptation of L* in this domain?\n- Can the authors provide more details on the specification construction approach and the motivation behind it?\n- How does the proposed method handle noisy data? Can the automaton still be learned from noisy data?\n- Can the authors provide a complexity analysis on the minimum amount of necessary training data?\n- Could the authors include a comparison with alternative methods to verify the improvements over state-of-the-art methods?\n\n**Soundness:**\n2 fair\n\n**Presentation:**\n3 good\n\n**Contribution:**\n2 fair\n\n**Rating:**\n3 reject, not good enough\n\n**Paper Decision:**\n- Decision: Reject\n- Reasons: The paper, while innovative in its approach, lacks a comprehensive evaluation of its method's performance on a diverse set of real-world problems. The method's adaptation of L* is not clearly explained, and the paper's focus on a single example (bouncing ball) limits its applicability to broader scenarios. The lack of numerical experiments and a thorough discussion on the assumptions and limitations of the proposed method further detracts from its strength. These issues collectively suggest that the paper is not yet ready for publication.",

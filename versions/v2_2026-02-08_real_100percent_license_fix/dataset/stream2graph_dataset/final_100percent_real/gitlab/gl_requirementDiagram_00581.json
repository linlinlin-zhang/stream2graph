  "code": "**Summary:**\nThe paper introduces a novel method called Deep Degradation Response (DDR) that utilizes CLIP textual features to assess image quality under various degradations. DDR encodes both the input image and its degraded version into features in CLIP space, then calculates the distance between these features to measure the degradation. The method is demonstrated to be effective across multiple applications, including blind image quality assessment and image restoration tasks like deblurring and super-resolution. The paper provides extensive experiments and analysis, including SRCC tests, and plans to release the code for public use.\n\n**Strengths:**\n- The paper proposes a novel approach using textual features from CLIP to measure image quality under various degradations, which is a significant departure from traditional image-based methods.\n- The method demonstrates effectiveness across multiple applications, including blind image quality assessment and image restoration, and is adaptable to different degradation scenarios.\n- The text-driven approach allows DDR to adjust degradation levels based on specific requirements, making it versatile and applicable to various use cases.\n- The experiment is detailed and well-written, providing a comprehensive evaluation of the proposed method.\n\n**Weaknesses:**\n- The paper lacks clarity in some technical details, particularly the distribution of DDR in Figure 2 and the specifics of how the method handles different degradation types.\n- The performance on blind image quality assessment (BIQA) is not particularly competitive, and the paper does not include comparisons with the latest IQA metrics such as LIQE, UNIQUE, and TreS.\n- The paper does not adequately explain why DDR outperforms other metrics like LPIPS, and the influence of the pre-trained model on DDR's performance is not discussed.\n- The network settings for single-image super-resolution (SISR) are somewhat unreasonable, and the paper could benefit from comparing the proposed method with simpler super-resolution networks and Q-Bench.\n- The paper does not provide a clear explanation of why DDR could represent the quality of an image, and the societal impact of the proposed method, particularly its potential for discriminatory use, is not thoroughly addressed.\n\n**Questions:**\n- Can the authors clarify the distribution of DDR in Figure 2 and explain why the \"adaptive\" distribution is superior to \"low\" and \"high\"?\n- How does DDR measure the amount of degradation, particularly in terms of noise level, and what does a high DDR indicate about the image distribution?\n- Given that the negative and positive values are fixed, does a high DDR indicate that the image distribution is robust to the feature interference caused by T_d?\n- Could the authors provide more details on the experimental settings, such as the learning rate and training resolution, to ensure fair comparison?\n- How does the proposed method compare with simpler super-resolution networks and Q-Bench, and what are the key differences between these methods?\n\n**Soundness:**\n2 fair\n\n**Presentation:**\n2 fair\n\n**Contribution:**\n2 fair\n\n**Rating:**\n5 marginally above the acceptance threshold\n\n**Paper Decision:**\n- Decision: Accept\n- Reasons: The decision to accept is based on the consensus among reviewers that the paper presents a technically solid method with a novel approach using textual features from CLIP to assess image quality under various degradations. The method is demonstrated to be effective across multiple applications, and the experimental results are supported by extensive analysis. Despite some concerns regarding clarity and the need for more comparisons with existing methods, the reviewers found that these issues were adequately addressed in the rebuttal phase. The decision aligns with the meta-review, which highlights the originality, methodological soundness, and significance of the results.",

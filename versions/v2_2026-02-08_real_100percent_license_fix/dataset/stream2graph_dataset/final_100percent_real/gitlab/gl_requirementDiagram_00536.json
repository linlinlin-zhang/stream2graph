  "code": "where \\(\\hat{\\sigma}_{j}^{+}\\)\\(\\hat{\\sigma}_{j}^{+}\\)is the raising operator ( \\(\\hat{\\sigma}_{j}^{+}=\\ket{e}_{j}\\bra{g}\\)\\(\\hat{\\sigma}_{j}^{+}=\\ket{e}_{j}\\bra{g}\\)) and \\(\\hat{\\sigma}_{j}^{-}\\)\\(\\hat{\\sigma}_{j}^{-}\\)the lowering operator ( \\(\\hat{\\sigma}_{j}^{-}=\\ket{g}_{j}\\bra{e}\\)\\(\\hat{\\sigma}_{j}^{-}=\\ket{g}_{j}\\bra{e}\\)) of the \\(j\\)th qubit. The label \\(n_{j}\\) can take any value between 1 and \\(N\\). In this work, the qubits are assumed to be arranged in a regular pattern with spacing \\(x\\), where \\(x/a=n_{j}-n_{j-1}\\). Related works considered regularly placed impurity qubits coupled to an atomic array [55, 56]. Our figures concentrate on \\(x/a=1\\). For reference, a larger qubit spacing \\(x/a=2\\)as well as the case where the qubits are all coupled to the same cavity ( \\(x/a=0\\)) are discussed in the text. Since the counter rotating terms are excluded in Eq. (5), our treatment is restricted to the weak coupling regime, i.e., \\(g\\ll J\\). The requirement that single- and two-photon processes are off-resonant [ \\(|(\\hbar\\omega_{c}-2J)-\\hbar\\omega_{e}|>g\\) and \\(|\\delta|>g\\)] can, for negative \\(\\delta\\) as considered in this work, be combined into one equation, namely \n\n\\[|U|>4J\\sqrt{\\left(1+\\frac{g}{4J}\\right)^{2}-1}.\\] (6)  \n\nFor fixed \\(U/J\\), Eq. (6) puts an upper limit on \\(g/J\\). Conversely, for fixed \\(g/J\\), Eq. (6) puts a lower limit on \\(|U|/J\\). \n\nThe total Hamiltonian conserves the number of total excitations (sum of qubit and photonic excitations) [12– \\(0\\), \\(1\\), \\(2\\), \\(\\dots\\) total excitations are decoupled. This work focuses on the two-excitation manifold. \n\n### Effective spin Hamiltonian \\(\\hat{H}_{\\text{spin}}\\)\\(\\hat{H}_{\\text{spin}}\\)\n\nAs mentioned above, we focus on negative detunings such that the energy of two excited qubits is in resonance with the band gap. We find that the band gap physics in the two-excitation manifold is well described by the spin Hamiltonian  \\(\\hat{H}_{\\text{spin}}\\)\\(\\hat{H}_{\\text{spin}}\\), which is derived by adiabatically eliminating the photon degrees of freedom in a two-step process (see Appendix A for details). We emphasize that the approach taken here is distinct from the master equation approach pursued in Ref. [45]. The first step is, in spirit, identical to prior work [45–47]. Neglecting the two-photon scattering continuum and adiabatically eliminating the single-photon states, effective constrained single-qubit hopping interactions of strength \\(W_{jl}\\)(see  \\(\\hat{H}_{\\text{single}}\\)\\(\\hat{H}_{\\text{single}}\\) below), effective interactions between states with two and no qubit excitations [ \\(F_{K,b}\\) in Eq. (A12)], and effective interactions between two two-photon bound states with wave vector \\(K\\) and \\(K^{\\prime}\\)[ \\(G_{K,K^{\\prime}}\\) in Eq. (A13)] arise. While the latter two interactions were discussed in Refs. [45–47], the effective qubit hopping interaction was not. The reason is that Refs. [45–47] focused on \\(N_{e}=2\\)(  \\(\\hat{H}_{\\text{single}}\\)\\(\\hat{H}_{\\text{single}}\\) vanishes for \\(N_{e}=2\\)). The hopping Hamiltonian \\(\\hat{H}_{\\text{single}}\\)\\(\\hat{H}_{\\text{single}}\\) reads \n\nH^single=12∑i,j,l=1Ne(Wj⁢lσ^i+σ^j+σ^i−σ^l−+ Wi⁢lσ^i+σ^j+σ^l−σ^j−). (7)  H^single=12∑i,j,l=1Ne(Wj⁢lσ^i+σ^j+σ^i−σ^l−+ Wi⁢lσ^i+σ^j+σ^l−σ^j−). (7)  \n\nSince the triple sum includes terms where two or three of the indices are equal, the order of the operators in Eq. (7) is important. As discussed in more detail below, \\(\\hat{H}_{\\text{single}}\\)\\(\\hat{H}_{\\text{single}}\\) describes constrained single-qubit hopping or constrained flip-flop interactions. We find that the effective interactions \\(G_{K,K^{\\prime}}\\) contribute negligibly to the band gap physics considered in this work; thus, they are set to zero. \n\nCalculations that treat the full Hamiltonian  \\(\\hat{H}\\)\\(\\hat{H}\\) show that the photonic contribution to the eigenstates is \\(10\\%\\)for the parameter combinations considered in this work. This motivates our second approximation, namely, the adiabatic elimination of the states \\(\\hat{B}_{K}^{\\dagger}\\ket{g,\\cdots,g,\\text{vac}}\\)\\(\\hat{B}_{K}^{\\dagger}\\ket{g,\\cdots,g,\\text{vac}}\\), i.e., basis kets that describe a photon pair with wave vector \\(K\\), with the qubits in the ground state. Step two yields the effective spin Hamiltonian \\(\\hat{H}_{\\text{spin}}\\)\\(\\hat{H}_{\\text{spin}}\\) (see Appendix A for details), \n\n\\[\\hat{H}_{\\text{spin}}=\\hat{H}_{\\text{single}}+\\hat{H}_{\\text{pair }},\\] (8)  \\[\\hat{H}_{\\text{spin}}=\\hat{H}_{\\text{single}}+\\hat{H}_{\\text{pair }},\\] (8)  \n\nwhere \n\n\\[\\hat{H}_{\\text{pair}}=\\sum_{i=1}^{N_{e}-1}\\sum_{j=i+1}^{N_{e}} \\sum_{l=1}^{N_{e}-1}\\sum_{h=l+1}^{N_{e}}Y_{ij,lh}\\hat{\\sigma}^{+}_{i}\\hat{ \\sigma}^{+}_{j}\\hat{\\sigma}^{-}_{l}\\hat{\\sigma}^{-}_{h}.\\] (9)  \\[\\hat{H}_{\\text{pair}}=\\sum_{i=1}^{N_{e}-1}\\sum_{j=i+1}^{N_{e}} \\sum_{l=1}^{N_{e}-1}\\sum_{h=l+1}^{N_{e}}Y_{ij,lh}\\hat{\\sigma}^{+}_{i}\\hat{ \\sigma}^{+}_{j}\\hat{\\sigma}^{-}_{l}\\hat{\\sigma}^{-}_{h}.\\] (9)  \n\nThe effective four-qubit (or two-qubit hopping) interactions \\(Y_{ij,lh}\\) emerge from the interactions \\(F_{K,b}\\) (see below). As might be expected naively, \\(W_{jl}\\) and \\(Y_{ij,lh}\\) are directly proportional to \\(g^{2}\\)and \\(g^{4}\\), respectively, since they emerge as a consequence of the first and second adiabatic elimination steps, respectively. The effective spin Hamiltonian FIG. 2: Schematic of the energy bands for the one- and twoexcitation manifolds for fixed \\(\\omega_{c}\\), \\(\\omega_{e}\\), and \\(U\\). This work focuses on the band gap regime, i.e., negative detunings \\(\\delta\\). Adiabatic elimination of the gray single-photon and green twophoton bound state bands introduces the effective interactions \\(W\\) and \\(Y\\) (see Fig. 3 for an illustration of these interactions), respectively, between qubit groups. The two-photon scattering continuum is far off-resonant and does not play a role. Explicit expressions for the energy bands can be found, e.g., in Ref. [53]. ",

Obviously, the reliability of the product is therefore only defined in combination with a defined application condition. A number of physical mechanisms are known to affect reliability in semiconductor devices. We can distinguish between affects of infant mortality, random failures and wear-out. Infant mortality failures are commonly known by the semiconductor manufacturer, and they prevent them by specific burn-in procedures where necessary. Random failures are characterized by a constant failure rate over most of the life time of a product. One example is destruction by cosmic radiation when a device is exposed to high blocking voltages over extended periods of time. ABB Semiconductors AG has established design rules which allow to specify the expected failure rate in _FIT_ (_,_failures in time\", i.e. the number of failures per \\(10^{9}\\) device hours) for a given design and operation condition. A typical value for a high power semiconductor device is 100 FIT. In pulsed power applications, this failure mode however is not very relevant. On the other hand, wear-out is a very important aspect for pulsed power. The dominant mechanism here is aging of the dry surfaces between the parts inside of the semiconductor housing. This leads to an increase of interface resistance and ultimately to device failure. In interdigital structures, the cathode segment metallization can be formed and pressed out into the gate region, which then creates a gate-to-cathode short circuit. The safe limit is determined by a number of times temperatures can step up and down a certain amount. The smaller the temperature step, the more cycles can be allowed for. In case of a given application condition, ABB Semiconductors AG is capable of estimating lifetime of a component. Fig. 12 shows a scanning electron micrograph of 2 segments of an interdigitality thirstor after 30 million current pulses of 12 kA amplitude and 2 \\(\\upmu\\)s duration. No wear-out can be seen. For this case, wear-out has been expected to appear after more than 100 million pulses only. Another example is given in Fig. 13. Here a cathode segment is seen from the top, as it appeared after a few thousand pulses of the same kind, but with unacceptable low and inhomogeneous mounting pressure on the component. The width of the metallization has become strongly inhomogeneous (147 to 166 \\(\\upmu\\)m), and a short circuit between cathode and gate is very likely now. The comparison of the two segments shows clearly that it is extremely important to pay attention to the way semiconductor components are mounted. For best reliability it therefore can be adventtagous to purchase full device stacks from the semiconductor manufacturer.\n\n## V Reliability\n\nIn contrast to quality (in its narrow definition), which includes fulfillment of the specification in all aspects,\n\nFigure 11: Monolitic Integrated trigger-unit for repetitive use and high voltage stacking.

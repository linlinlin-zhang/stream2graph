  "code": "**Summary:**\nThe paper introduces Federated Black-box Prompt Tuning (FedBPT), a novel framework designed to address challenges in fine-tuning Pre-trained Language Models (PLMs) using Federated Learning (FL). FedBPT employs a gradient-free optimization method, CMA-ES, to optimize the trainable prompt parameters without requiring model access or back-propagation. It also incorporates random masking techniques to prevent overfitting and reduce communication and memory requirements. The framework is evaluated on several benchmark datasets, showing improvements in model performance, communication cost, and memory efficiency compared to traditional methods.\n\n**Strengths:**\n- The paper is well-written, making it accessible and easy to follow.\n- The problem formulation and inference presented in the paper are clear, enhancing reader comprehension.\n- The approach to address the overfitting problem using random perturbation is innovative and has proven effective in various domains.\n- The paper provides a detailed theoretical analysis and a derivation of the step size related to the CMA-ES aggregation on the server side, making the method theoretically more reliable.\n- The experiments are comprehensive, covering state-of-the-art pretrained models like LLaMA and RoBERTa, and providing comparisons from the perspectives of model performance, communication cost, memory, and other factors.\n- The paper addresses the challenges of fine-tuning LLMs in federated learning (FL) and provides a potential solution by eliminating the need for clients to access model parameters.\n\n**Weaknesses:**\n- The paper lacks a clear comparison in terms of computation costs between the proposed method and baselines, making it difficult to assess the overall efficiency of the proposed method.\n- The experimental results show that even with 80% of tokens masked or replaced, the model trained on these \"noisy data\" outperforms that of vanilla BBT, which is surprising and needs further analysis or experiments.\n- The paper does not adequately address the privacy risks associated with transferring vector z, which could potentially expose sensitive information about the training data.\n- The paper's motivation is questioned as it assumes that LLMs can only provide API inference, which may not be feasible in real-world federated learning scenarios where data privacy is crucial.\n- The paper's experiments are criticized for using outdated and basic baseline methods for prompt tuning, which could undermine the effectiveness of the proposed method.\n- The paper's focus on classification tasks is seen as too simple, and it does not adequately address more complex tasks like question answering.\n\n**Questions:**\n- What are the rectangle colors in Figure 3, and could the caption be improved to better explain this?\n- Can the authors clarify whether the perturbation added randomly or with semantic information, and how this affects the model's performance?\n- Is there a specific reason why FedAvg performs noticeably worse than other prompt tuning methods in the experiments?\n- How can the authors enable inference without transferring data in the black-box setting?\n- Can the authors demonstrate the learned prompts in the experiments and discuss the relationship between these prompts and the training data?\n- Can the authors add FL baselines on non-IID data by treating z as a model?\n- How do the dimensions $d$ and $D$ in the prompt affect model performance, and why is the length of the prompt not a focus of the design?\n\n**Soundness:**\n2 fair\n\n**Presentation:**\n3 good\n\n**Contribution:**\n2 fair\n\n**Rating:**\n5 marginally below the acceptance threshold\n\n**Paper Decision:**\n- Decision: Reject\n- Reasons: The paper, while introducing an innovative approach to fine-tuning LLMs in federated learning, suffers from several significant drawbacks. The primary concerns include the lack of clear comparisons in terms of computation costs, the surprising performance of models trained on \"noisy data,\" and the limited novelty of the proposed method compared to existing techniques. Additionally, the paper's experimental setup and baseline comparisons are criticized for being outdated and insufficiently challenging. These issues collectively lead to a decision to reject the paper.",

  "code": "**Summary:**\nThe paper introduces Auto-DPSGD, a modified version of DPSGD, which incorporates automatic clipping and noise multiplier scheduling. The authors propose several noise multiplier decay methods and different learning rate schedules to enhance the accuracy of DP-SGD. The paper provides theoretical explanations and experimental validations on classic datasets, aiming to improve the privacy-utility trade-off. However, concerns are raised about the effectiveness of the proposed methods, their computational feasibility, and the differential privacy compliance. The paper is criticized for its experimental limitations, including the use of mostly toy models and datasets, and for not thoroughly evaluating the methods across a diverse range of models and datasets.\n\n**Strengths:**\n- The paper introduces and compares several noise multiplier decay methods and different learning rate schedules to identify a more effective approach for implementing DP-SGD, aiming to enhance accuracy.\n- The proposed DP-SGD is new and the experiments cover many aspects including learning rate, noise schedule, and task types.\n- The authors provide a detailed introduction about the main analytic tools in DP and use them in the following parts.\n- The experiment parts are shown in detail with high reproductivity.\n- The paper proposes a detailed introduction about the main analytic tools in DP and uses them in the following parts.\n\n**Weaknesses:**\n- The paper is over the ICLR page limit and violates some margins, which may lead to desk rejection.\n- The contribution is not significant, and the original content from this work only starts from page 5.\n- The proposed Auto DP-T/S/E noise multiplier decay mechanisms are trivial and not present in the main text.\n- The proposed Algorithm 1 is computationally infeasible and memory prohibitive, making it impractical for large models.\n- The paper does not thoroughly evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed methods across a diverse range of machine learning models and datasets, which is crucial for assessing their efficacy.\n- The paper does not clearly present theoretical novelty and lacks privacy preservation guarantees in the main context.\n- The related work section needs to include more recent studies, and the comparison table for related work might be beneficial.\n- The paper does not adequately address the privacy level or utility level improvements compared to standard DPSGD.\n- The paper primarily uses CIFAR datasets, which may not be sufficient for comprehensive evaluation.\n- The paper does not discuss the computation inefficiency of Algorithm 1, which is a significant drawback.\n\n**Questions:**\n- According to the paper, how does DP protect \"personally identifiable information (PII) in deep learning (DL) applications\"?\n- How does the proposed Auto DP-SGD ensure differential privacy, especially considering the potential divergence in noisy gradient sum distributions?\n- Can the authors clarify why the proposed method is important and how it influences the utility-privacy trade-off compared to standard DPSGD?\n- How are parameters determined in the real treatment, such as scaling factors or variants?\n- Could the authors provide more theoretical analysis on how much improvement in privacy or utility level is achieved compared to standard DPSGD?\n- How do the authors justify the use of large ϵ values in DP, which seem meaningless in practical applications?\n\n**Soundness:**\n2 fair\n\n**Presentation:**\n2 fair\n\n**Contribution:**\n2 fair\n\n**Rating:**\n3 reject, not good enough\n\n**Paper Decision:**\n- Decision: Reject\n- Reasons: The paper, while introducing new methods for DP-SGD, lacks significant experimental validation across diverse models and datasets, which is crucial for assessing the efficacy of the proposed methods. The computational feasibility and memory requirements of the proposed algorithms are also major concerns, making them impractical for large-scale applications. The paper's contribution is not substantial enough to overcome these significant shortcomings, leading to a decision to reject.",

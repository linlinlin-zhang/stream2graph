  "code": "**Summary:**\nThe paper introduces a novel approach to multimodal physical scene understanding by proposing a disentangled acoustic fields (DAF) model. This model aims to enhance audio perception by transforming sound from the waveform domain into power spectral density (PSD) representation, which is then used to infer physical properties of a scene and navigate to locate fallen objects. The DAF model is designed to address the generalization limitations of previous models like NAFs by explicitly disentangling sounds into several different acoustic factors. The paper presents a bi-directional encoder-decoder architecture for predicting acoustic scenes and synthesizing scene sounds from scene parameters, which is evaluated using two public benchmarks. However, the experiments are limited to two different scenarios, kitchen and study room, which may not fully demonstrate the generalization capabilities of the DAF model.\n\n**Strengths:**\n- The problem addressed is interesting and relevant, focusing on enhancing audio perception through an analysis-by-synthesis framework.\n- The proposed disentangled acoustic fields (DAFs) are a novel and technically sound model that effectively disentangles sounds into several different acoustic factors.\n- The transformation of sound from the waveform domain into power spectral density (PSD) representation is well-motivated and maintains consistency with the input audio.\n- The architecture is designed to analyze and synthesize audio scenes effectively, particularly when paired with object properties.\n- The paper demonstrates the effectiveness of the proposed framework through downstream multi-modal planning experiments.\n\n**Weaknesses:**\n- The title \"physical scene understanding\" may be overclaimed, as the audio perception is limited to constrained scenarios such as fallen objects.\n- The paper lacks novelty in its main contribution, as the DAFs are similar to existing models in audio modality and do not significantly innovate beyond existing methods.\n- The experiments are conducted primarily on synthetic datasets, which may not adequately demonstrate the model's generalization capabilities to real-world data.\n- The requirement for full labels to train DAFs could be a limitation, suggesting a need for a self-supervised learning approach to reduce the reliance on labeled data.\n- The integration of visual information into DAFs is not explored, which could potentially enhance the model's performance by incorporating additional acoustic cues.\n- Comparative experiments with previous methods for sound source localization are missing, which could justify the effectiveness of the proposed method in terms of position errors of sound sources.\n\n**Questions:**\n- Why are the experiments limited to only two different scenarios, kitchen and study room, when the authors claim that the method is generalizable?\n- How does the proposed method compare with previous methods for sound source localization, particularly in terms of position errors of sound sources?\n- Could you provide a video demo or additional experimental clarity to better illustrate the model's performance in real-world scenarios?\n- Why was the decision made to not incorporate visual information into DAFs, and what are the potential benefits of doing so?\n- How does the proposed method handle scenarios where labeled data is not available, and what steps are being taken to address this limitation?\n\n**Soundness:**\n2 fair\n\n**Presentation:**\n2 fair\n\n**Contribution:**\n2 fair\n\n**Rating:**\n5 marginally below the acceptance threshold\n\n**Paper Decision:**\n- Decision: Reject\n- Reasons: The decision to reject is based on several factors. First, the generalization capabilities of the DAF model are not convincingly demonstrated, as the experiments are limited to only two scenarios. Second, the novelty of the proposed method is questioned, as it is seen as an incremental improvement over existing models like NAFs. Third, the paper lacks comparative experiments with previous methods, which are crucial for establishing the effectiveness of the proposed method. Lastly, the presentation and clarity of the experimental sections need improvement to better illustrate the real-world applicability of the model.",

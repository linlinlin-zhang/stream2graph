Use the graphical method to solve the equation $3 x^{2}-8 x-5=0$ for $-1 \\leq x \\leq 4$\n\n\\section*{SECTION B (60 marks)}\n\nAnswer any FOUR questions from this section.\n11. (a) Explain three ways in which a researcher could classify statistical data.\n(b) Given two matrices $\\mathbf{A}=\\left[\\begin{array}{rrr}7 & -8 & 5 \\\\ -4 & 5 & -3 \\\\ 1 & -1 & 1\\end{array}\\right]$ and that $\\mathbf{B}=\\left[\\begin{array}{rrr}2 & 2 & -1 \\\\ 1 & 2 & 1 \\\\ -1 & -1 & 3\\end{array}\\right]$, show that $\\mathbf{A B}=\\mathbf{I}$.\n(c) Mwariki motorbike dealers assemble its products in two plants; one in Nairobi and another in Nakuru. The Nairobi plant assembles $60 \\%$ of the motorbikes. It has been found out that $4 \\%$ of the Nairobi motorbikes are defective as well as $5 \\%$ from Nakuru.\n(i) Use a tree diagram to present this information;\n(ii) Determine the probability that a bike selected at random is defective and comes from Nairobi.\n(iii) Determine the probability that a bike selected at random is not defective.\n12. (a) Describe each of the following in words:\n(i) $\\{x|x\\rangle 0$ and $x \\in \\mathfrak{R}\\}$ :\n(ii) $\\{$ Birds $\\mid$ the bird is a mammal $\\}$.\n(b) Solve each of the following inequalities:\n(i) $\\quad-2(x-3)<5(x+1)-12$;\n(ii) $-3<\\frac{3}{2}(2-x) \\leq 5$.\n(c) Table 1 shows the price of various products in supermarkets $M$ and $N$. Use it to answer the questions that follow.\n\\begin{tabular}{|l|c|c|}\n\\hline \\multirow{2}{*}{ Item } & \\multicolumn{2}{|c|}{ Supermarket } \\\\\n\\cline { 2 - 3 } & M & N \\\\\n\\hline Sugar & Kshs 230 per kg & Kshs 250 per kg \\\\\n\\hline Flour & Kshs 125 per pct & Kshs 140 per pct \\\\\n\\hline Oil & Kshs 455 per Ltr & Kshs 425 per Ltr \\\\\n\\hline\n\\end{tabular}\n\nTable 1\nLucy intends to buy 5 Kgs of sugar, 6 packets of flour and 3 litres of oil.\n(i) Represent this information in matrix form showing the price and item matrices.\n(ii) Determine the total cost of the items from each supermarket using the matrix method.\n13.

  "code": "**Summary:**\nThe paper introduces AdjointDEIS, a method that utilizes adjoint sensitivity analysis to efficiently compute gradients of diffusion models, specifically focusing on the probability flow ODE implementation of diffusion models. This method is designed to optimize latent variables and hyperparameters, reducing the computational burden and memory requirements compared to traditional methods. The paper presents a novel approach to solving the adjoint diffusion SDE and probability flow ODE, which is validated through experiments on a face morphing problem. The methodology is shown to be effective in reducing the computational complexity and improving the accuracy of gradient computations, which could potentially open new avenues for applications in data assimilation and inverse problems.\n\n**Strengths:**\n- The paper is well-written, with clear explanations and concrete proofs on theorems and experiments with real data.\n- The authors provide a comprehensive derivation for both the probability flow formulation and the SDE formulation, which is a significant contribution to the field.\n- The development of specialized solvers for diffusion models demonstrates a practical application of the method.\n- The general presentation of the paper is well-done, starting with a straightforward setting of an ODE and extending to SDEs.\n- The paper is comprehensive, presenting both theoretical and empirical results, and the derivations are mostly clear.\n\n**Weaknesses:**\n- The experimental scope of the method is limited, with only one application to face morphing being demonstrated.\n- The paper lacks proof of convergence rates or empirical studies of convergence rate, which could strengthen the claims made.\n- The significance of the proposed method is not clearly established, especially in comparison to existing methods like those used in Neural SDEs.\n- The experimental results seem weak, with no control over the number of function evaluations (NFE) across baselines, which makes it difficult to draw definitive conclusions about the performance of the method.\n- The paper does not implement AdjointDEIS-2M and does not compare it with other methods, which could have provided additional insights into the effectiveness of the proposed method.\n\n**Questions:**\n- Could the authors provide a visual representation of forward and backward trajectories of the diffusion processes to better understand the behavior of the model?\n- What is the typical magnitude of numerical errors that accumulate during the backward ODE solve?\n- Why is the method, which is an approximation due to omitting higher order terms in the Taylor expansion, performing better than other methods in Table 1?\n- Why does the SDE version of the method perform worse than the ODE version, as mentioned in the paper?\n- Could the authors clarify the similarity between the integral results in the SDE and ODE cases, particularly in equations (4.12) and (4.13) versus (3.13) and (3.14)?\n- How does the selection of the face morph application impact the empirical comparisons in Table 1, given the different NFE for the methods?\n\n**Soundness:**\n3 good\n\n**Presentation:**\n3 good\n\n**Contribution:**\n3 good\n\n**Rating:**\n6 marginally above the acceptance threshold\n\n**Paper Decision:**\n- Decision: Accept\n- Reasons: The paper presents a novel method, AdjointDEIS, which effectively utilizes adjoint sensitivity analysis to optimize latent variables and hyperparameters in diffusion models. The method is technically sound, as evidenced by the experimental validation on a face morphing problem, and the theoretical contributions are well-articulated. The reviewers have highlighted the potential for broader applications in data assimilation and inverse problems, which could further enhance the impact of the work. Despite some concerns regarding the limited experimental scope and the need for more comprehensive empirical studies, the overall strengths of the paper outweigh these limitations, making it a suitable candidate for acceptance.",

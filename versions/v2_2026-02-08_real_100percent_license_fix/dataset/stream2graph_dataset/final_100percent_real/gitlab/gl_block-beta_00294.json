  "code": "**Summary:**\nThe paper introduces PrivCirNet, a novel framework designed to enhance the efficiency of private DNN inference using homomorphic encryption (HE) and multi-party computation (MPC) schemes. By converting DNN weights into block circulant matrices, the framework transforms general matrix-vector multiplications into HE-friendly 1-dimensional convolutions, significantly reducing computational overhead. The framework includes a latency-aware formulation to search for optimal layer-wise block size assignments using second-order information and employs layer fusion techniques to minimize inference costs. Extensive evaluations and comparisons with existing methods demonstrate the proposed framework's effectiveness in reducing latency and improving accuracy across various models and datasets.\n\n**Strengths:**\n- The paper introduces a novel encoding algorithm, CirEncode, optimized for block circulant weight matrices, which reduces the HE computation in proportion to the block size.\n- The use of block circulant transformation for optimizing HE-based DNN inference at the HE/MPC hybrid approach is innovative and addresses a critical issue in privacy-preserving machine learning.\n- The paper includes thorough evaluations and comparisons with existing methods, providing strong evidence of the proposed framework's effectiveness.\n- The structure and presentation of the paper are clear, making the methodology and results easy to understand.\n- The framework addresses a significant problem by improving the efficiency of secure inference systems, which is crucial for privacy-preserving applications.\n\n**Weaknesses:**\n- The paper does not provide the actual implementation code needed to reproduce the simulation results, which limits the reproducibility of the research.\n- The implementation details for multi-party computation (MPC) are not clearly presented, making it difficult to understand the full implementation of the proposed framework.\n- The results report overall latency without distinguishing between the HE part and the MPC part, which makes it difficult to discern the extent of performance improvement specifically attributed to HE.\n- The paper lacks comparative experiments with communication traffic, which is a critical aspect of privacy-preserving systems.\n- Some statements are misleading, and the presentation could be improved to avoid misunderstandings.\n- The details of how nonlinear layers are evaluated are missing, and the comparison with prior work BOLT is not fair as BOLT is specifically designed and optimized for transformers.\n\n**Questions:**\n- In Figure 9, the comparison of latency and accuracy is conducted against the worst-case scenarios of existing work. Is this comparison fair?\n- Why is MobileNetV2 used for benchmarking, and why is there a discrepancy in the accuracy of MobileNetV2 after 50% compression of the proposed method compared to uncompressed?\n- What adaptations have been made to BOLT for the models considered in the paper, and how does the proposed method compare to BOLT in terms of general matrix multiplications?\n- Which crypto primitive is used for evaluating the nonlinear computations, and does your code include the MPC part?\n- Why choose BFV over the more fractional-friendly CKKS, and why is the table layout inconsistent?\n- In the motivation section, it is mentioned that linear layers are the bottleneck of BOLT. However, from BOLT's results, the nonlinear layers seem to occupy more than 70% of the runtime in the WAN setting. Can this be clarified?\n\n**Soundness:**\n3 good\n\n**Presentation:**\n3 good\n\n**Contribution:**\n3 good\n\n**Rating:**\n6 marginally above the acceptance threshold\n\n**Paper Decision:**\n- Decision: Accept\n- Reasons: The paper presents a novel approach to optimizing HE-based DNN inference by leveraging block circulant matrices, which is technically sound and demonstrates significant improvements in both latency and accuracy. The methodology is well-structured, and the experiments are comprehensive, providing strong evidence of the proposed framework's effectiveness. The reviewers have highlighted some concerns regarding the reproducibility of the results and the clarity in explaining the implementation details of MPC. However, these issues do not significantly detract from the overall strength of the paper. The decision to accept is based on the paper's originality, methodological soundness, and the significant impact it could have on the field of privacy-preserving machine learning.",

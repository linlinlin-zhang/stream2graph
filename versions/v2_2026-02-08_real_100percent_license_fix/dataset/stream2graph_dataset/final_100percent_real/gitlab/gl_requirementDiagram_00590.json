  "code": "**Summary:**\nThe paper introduces an autoregressive image diffusion (AID) model for generating image sequences and accelerating MRI reconstruction. The model leverages inter-image dependencies to improve reconstruction from undersampled k-space data in MRI, outperforming standard diffusion models in terms of PSNR and NRMSE metrics. The AID model is trained on the fastMRI dataset using 4 NVIDIA A100 GPUs for 440,000 iterations with the Adam optimizer. The model's architecture includes components like DiTBlock, DDIM, and VQVAE, and it demonstrates reduced hallucinations in reconstructed images compared to standard models. The paper provides a detailed theoretical foundation for the model and evaluates its effectiveness across various sampling masks and undersampling factors.\n\n**Strengths:**\n- The paper presents a novel combination of autoregressive and diffusion models for image sequence generation, which is well-motivated, particularly for medical imaging applications like MRI reconstruction.\n- The authors provide a comprehensive set of experiments demonstrating improved performance over standard diffusion models, effectively leveraging inter-image dependencies to enhance reconstruction quality.\n- The paper offers a detailed theoretical foundation for the proposed model, deriving the training loss and sampling algorithm in a clear and reproducible manner.\n- The experimental methodology is robust, using appropriate datasets and metrics for evaluation across various sampling patterns and undersampling factors.\n- The model's ability to generate coherent image sequences is demonstrated through retrospective and prospective sampling.\n- The paper discusses the potential broader impact of the model on medical imaging applications and acknowledges limitations, proposing future work and showing scientific integrity.\n- The model architecture is clearly explained and illustrated with helpful diagrams, demonstrating flexibility in handling different types of undersampled k-space data.\n- The paper includes both qualitative and quantitative assessments of the model's performance, providing visual examples that effectively illustrate the improvements in image quality.\n\n**Weaknesses:**\n- The evaluation is primarily limited to medical imaging datasets, lacking comparison on standard image datasets.\n- The paper does not thoroughly discuss potential negative societal impacts or ethical considerations of the technology.\n- Computational requirements and efficiency compared to standard methods are not extensively discussed.\n- The paper lacks comparison with other state-of-the-art approaches beyond standard diffusion models and does not provide standard generative model metrics like FID or Inception Score.\n- The sensitivity to hyperparameter choices, particularly sequence length, is not thoroughly explored.\n- The paper does not explore the model's performance on other medical imaging modalities beyond MRI and lacks a detailed analysis of the model's failure cases or limitations.\n- There is no discussion on the interpretability of the model's decisions or outputs and no exploration of the model's robustness to adversarial attacks or noise in the input data.\n- The paper lacks discussion on the model's ability to handle multi-modal or multi-contrast imaging data and does not explore the potential for transfer learning or fine-tuning the model on different datasets.\n- The paper does not address the privacy implications of using the model in clinical settings or provide a comparison of training times or computational resources required versus other methods.\n\n**Questions:**\n- What is the computational cost of the proposed method compared to standard diffusion models, both in training and inference?\n- How sensitive is the model to the choice of hyperparameters, particularly the sequence length?\n- Can the model be extended to handle multi-modal or multi-contrast imaging data?\n- What are the privacy implications of using this model in clinical settings? How does the model's performance scale with increasing dataset size or diversity?\n- Can the model be adapted for other medical imaging modalities beyond MRI?\n- What is the potential for integrating this model into existing clinical workflows or systems?\n- How does the model handle cases where there are significant anatomical variations between sequential images?\n- Can the model be extended to generate 3D volumetric data or time-series data?\n- How do different k-space sampling patterns impact the model's performance?\n- How does the model perform when there are motion artifacts or other types of image degradation?\n- Can the model be used for other tasks, such as image segmentation or anomaly detection in medical imaging?\n\n**Soundness:**\n2 fair\n\n**Presentation:**\n3 good\n\n**Contribution:**\n3 good\n\n**Rating:**\n6 marginally above the acceptance threshold\n\n**Paper Decision:**\n- Decision: Accept\n- Reasons: The paper introduces a novel approach to image diffusion for MRI reconstruction, combining autoregressive and diffusion models to leverage inter-image dependencies. The model shows significant improvements over standard diffusion models in terms of reconstruction quality and reduction of hallucinations in reconstructed images. Despite some limitations, such as the lack of experimental comparisons against baselines and the limitation to 2D data, the paper makes a substantial contribution to the field and provides a detailed theoretical foundation for its methodology. The authors have addressed these concerns in their rebuttal by providing stronger baselines and discussing the results in 3D, which strengthens the paper's case for acceptance. The decision to accept is supported by the meta-review, which highlights the paper's originality, methodological soundness, and significance of results, despite some concerns about the clarity and depth of the evaluation.",

  "code": "**Summary:**\nThe paper introduces DAGER, a method leveraging the low-rankness of self-attention gradients to reconstruct input text in Centralized Federated Learning. DAGER filters out incorrect embeddings and recursively reconstructs true input text by exploiting the linearity of the self-attention layer's gradients. The method is evaluated against various baselines and shows significant improvements in performance. However, concerns are raised about the computational complexity, scalability, and potential ethical implications of the method.\n\n**Strengths:**\n- The paper presents a novel approach to reconstruct text by disregarding all embeddings which do not align with the low rank gradients received by the server, which is a smart and practical method.\n- The empirical results demonstrate that this method is highly effective and significantly outperforms all other baselines.\n- The paper is well-written, with clear diagrams and figures that make it accessible to readers not well-versed in the area.\n- Solid experiments and mathematical proofs support the findings, and the authors provide complete ablation studies and detailed experiments in various aspects.\n- The idea is straightforward and effective, with impressive numerical improvements over the state of the art.\n\n**Weaknesses:**\n- The computational complexity of DAGER is a concern, particularly the large search space which could lead to significant computational overhead.\n- The paper could benefit from a more detailed discussion on how it differs from current methods in the field of gradient leakage in the text domain.\n- Notation is heavy and could be improved by adding a notation table or input before the algorithm for better clarity.\n- The theoretical development is weak, and the technical assumptions need better justification, particularly regarding the loss function and differentiability.\n- The requirement that the number of tokens used by a single client in a single training step is smaller than the dimension of the embedding space is not convincingly justified.\n- The embedded tokens are not linearly independent, and there could be significant false positives in the procedure, yet the authors observed otherwise.\n\n**Questions:**\n- Could DAGER work within a decentralized FL environment, where a single client acts as the aggregator? How would asynchronous training affect its performance?\n- How does DAGER perform against noise or malicious users? Can it be amended to combat these issues?\n- What does \"starting tokens\" refer to in the context mentioned on page 6? Why is this an important issue to mention?\n- Would higher layers (L>2) also help in the recovery process? Why is this not considered?\n- How does the method in Algorithm 1 work so effectively, and why are the embedded tokens not linearly independent?\n- Could the authors discuss the usage of quantized models and the influence of Lora for fine-tuning regarding reconstruction results?\n- Can the authors provide some reconstructed text for comparison?\n\n**Soundness:**\n3 good\n\n**Presentation:**\n3 good\n\n**Contribution:**\n3 good\n\n**Rating:**\n7 accept, but needs minor improvements\n\n**Paper Decision:**\n- Decision: Accept\n- Reasons: The paper presents a novel approach to reconstructing input text in Centralized Federated Learning, leveraging the low-rankness of self-attention gradients. The method is technically sound, with empirical results demonstrating its effectiveness and outperformance over baselines. However, concerns were raised about the computational complexity and scalability, which could limit its practical application. The ethical implications of the method were also discussed, but no major unaddressed ethical concerns were identified. The reviewers were generally positive, and the authors provided a good rebuttal in the revisions. The decision to accept as a poster aligns with the overall positive reception and the potential impact of the method in the field.",

  "code": "**Summary:**\nThe paper explores the extension of the Schrödinger Bridge problem to the unbalanced setting, where initial and final marginals of the process are not probability measures. The authors derive a time-reversal formula with killing and birth terms to adapt the Iterative Proportional Fitting (IPF) algorithm to this problem. They also introduce a heuristic estimation of Ψ to avoid the estimation of logφt, which is crucial for the unbalanced diffusion Schrödinger Bridge (UDSB). The paper applies these methods to a toy example and a single-cell trajectory inference task, demonstrating the practical utility of the UDSB algorithm.\n\n**Strengths:**\n- The paper is well-written, mathematically sound, and the conditions and statements of every theorem are written rigorously, making it easy to follow the mathematical logic.\n- The introduction and motivations are clear, and the authors provide an extensive theoretical framework, including the derivation of an optimization problem and the study of its optimality conditions.\n- The paper includes a detailed explanation of how to sample from the proposed method, which is crucial for practical applications.\n- The authors demonstrate the performance of their method on both a synthetic and a real-world dataset, showing the applicability of the theory to real-world problems.\n\n**Weaknesses:**\n- The paper is mathematically heavy and assumes a high level of mathematical knowledge from the reader, making it difficult for non-experts to understand.\n- The experimental validation is limited, with only one competitor compared, and the dataset used is not extensively tested against other methods or datasets.\n- The clarity of the paper could be improved by providing more details on the Diffusion Schrödinger Bridge in the related work and linking the different concepts to their unbalanced extension in Sections 4 and 5.\n- The paper lacks a comprehensive discussion on the computational complexity and robustness of the method, which is crucial for practical applications.\n- The practical implementation of the algorithm is difficult to understand, follow, and reproduce, which could limit its adoption by the broader community.\n\n**Questions:**\n- What happens when the measures have the same mass? Do you recover the original IPF and Schrödinger Bridge?\n- Can your method be applied to other single-cell dynamics datasets, and if so, how does your method compare to other methods?\n- Why is the TD loss needed, and can the algorithm work without it? Is there an ablation study on how this loss influences the final quality of the results?\n- How is the data partitioned into training and test for the experiments, and how is it known that the observed mass increases 35% but then decreases to -25% from the original total mass?\n- The requirement that k is non-negative is not a standard requirement in unbalanced dynamic OT. Could the authors explain this requirement and its necessity in the theory?\n\n**Soundness:**\n2 fair\n\n**Presentation:**\n2 fair\n\n**Contribution:**\n3 good\n\n**Rating:**\n3 reject, not good enough\n\n**Paper Decision:**\n- Decision: Reject\n- Reasons: The paper, while theoretically sound and presenting an interesting approach to the Schrödinger Bridge problem, suffers from significant practical limitations. The experimental results are not convincing, and the method's efficiency and applicability to high-dimensional tasks are not demonstrated. The paper's presentation is also criticized for being difficult to follow and understand, which could limit its accessibility to a broader audience. Additionally, the computational complexity and robustness of the method are not discussed, which is crucial for practical applications. These factors collectively lead to the decision to reject the paper.",

  "code": "**Summary:**\nVMamba is a novel vision backbone model inspired by the Mamba state-space model, designed to efficiently handle visual representation learning with linear computational complexity. The core innovation is the VSS block, which incorporates a 2D-Selective-Scan (SS2D) module, adapting the 1D selective scan of Mamba for 2D image data. VMamba is evaluated across various visual perception tasks, including image classification, object detection, and semantic segmentation, demonstrating superior accuracy, scalability, and adaptability compared to existing models. The paper provides extensive experimental results and visualizations to support its claims, and the model's architecture is optimized for computational efficiency using the Triton language.\n\n**Strengths:**\n- VMamba is one of the first papers to adapt the Mamba model, known for its efficiency and performance in linear complexity models, to learn visual data, demonstrating effectiveness.\n- The paper introduces the 2D-Selective-Scan (SS2D) module, which creatively adapts the original 1D sequential scanning to process 2D image data, enhancing model speed without compromising performance.\n- Comprehensive experiments are conducted across multiple benchmarks, including ImageNet-1K, MSCOCO, and ADE20K, demonstrating the model's effectiveness and robustness across various tasks.\n- The paper is well-written, with clear explanations and detailed descriptions of the architecture, modules, and experimental setups, making it accessible to readers.\n- Visualizations, such as activation maps and effective receptive fields (ERF), are used to help understand the SS2D mechanism and the model's behavior, which is crucial for all ablation studies.\n- VMamba addresses a critical issue in vision models by reducing computational complexity from quadratic to linear, which can significantly impact the field of visual representation learning.\n\n**Weaknesses:**\n- The paper could benefit from a more detailed comparison with other state-space models (SSMs) in the vision domain, particularly models like S4ND and Vim, to strengthen the argument for VMamba's superiority.\n- There is a lack of clarity in mathematical derivations, especially in the relationship between SS2D and self-attention, which may not be easily accessible to all readers.\n- The generalization of VMamba to other types of visual tasks beyond image classification, object detection, and segmentation is not thoroughly explored.\n- The paper could include more interesting works related to neuromorphic vision and processing with SSMs in the related work section.\n- Some of the mathematical derivations and the relationship between SS2D and self-attention are complex and may not be easily understood without additional visual or simplified explanations.\n\n**Questions:**\n- Could the authors explain more on the statement in Lines 153-154, “such modification prevents the weights from being input-independent, resulting in a limited capacity for capturing contextual information”?\n- Could you provide more detailed comparisons with other state-space models (SSMs) used in the vision domain, such as S4ND and Vim, in terms of accuracy, computational efficiency, and memory usage?\n- How well does VMamba generalize to other types of visual tasks beyond image classification, object detection, and segmentation? Have you considered evaluating VMamba on tasks such as video analysis, 3D vision, or more complex scene understanding?\n- How sensitive is VMamba to various hyperparameters? Are there guidelines or best practices for tuning them?\n- How easily can VMamba be integrated into existing deep learning frameworks and pipelines? Are there any specific requirements or modifications needed for seamless integration?\n\n**Soundness:**\n4 excellent\n\n**Presentation:**\n4 excellent\n\n**Contribution:**\n3 good\n\n**Rating:**\n8 accept, good paper\n\n**Paper Decision:**\n- Decision: Accept\n- Reasons: The paper introduces VMamba, a vision backbone model that effectively adapts the Mamba state-space model for visual data processing, achieving linear computational complexity. The model's performance is demonstrated across various visual perception tasks, showing superior accuracy and efficiency compared to existing models. The paper is well-written, with clear explanations and comprehensive experimental results, and the use of visualizations enhances understanding of the model's behavior. The reviewers have highlighted the model's potential for generalization and its impact on the field of visual representation learning. Despite some limitations mentioned, such as the need for more detailed comparisons with other SSMs and a lack of clarity in mathematical derivations, the overall strengths and contributions of the paper justify its acceptance.",

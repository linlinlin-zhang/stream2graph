  "code": "**Summary:**\nThe paper introduces a novel method, P2L, for solving image inverse problems using latent diffusion models. P2L integrates prompt tuning to tailor the model to specific tasks and projection optimization to ensure generated images are realistic and free of artefacts. The method optimizes both the latent variables and the null-embeddings, which is a significant contribution to the field. Extensive experiments on datasets like FFHQ and ImageNet demonstrate the effectiveness of P2L, showing improvements over existing methods. However, the paper lacks a theoretical analysis of convergence and the results are not very promising, with subtle performance gains and insignificant differences in ablation experiments.\n\n**Strengths:**\n- The idea of using learnable prompts to improve the performance of diffusion models in solving inverse problems is novel and effective.\n- The method optimizes both the latent variables and the null-embeddings, which is a significant contribution to the field.\n- The paper achieves state-of-the-art performance in several tasks, including super-resolution, deblurring, and inpainting.\n- The paper is well-written, with clear explanations and sufficient details to reproduce the results.\n- The motivation behind using learnable prompts is meaningful and the experiments on different kinds of image inverse tasks are comprehensive.\n\n**Weaknesses:**\n- The paper lacks a theoretical analysis of convergence and the results are not very promising, with subtle performance gains and insignificant differences in ablation experiments.\n- The writing is poor and the submission is hard to follow, with some sections being confusing and unclear.\n- The proposed method is complicated and involves many parameters which may be difficult to tune, as shown in Table 6.\n- The method is expensive in computation and there is a lack of experimental evidence to prove that it can solve large-scale inverse problems.\n- The description about PSLD in the paper is not fully correct, and the comparison with the DIS method termed PGDM is missing.\n- The practicality of the proposed method is limited, with P2L being significantly slower than DPS and requiring extensive hyper-parameter tuning.\n\n**Questions:**\n- How do you go from equation (11) to (12)? It is assumed that $C$ and $z_t$ are independent. However, this assumption is not properly justified?\n- How many $C$ updates per $z_t$ update is needed? How does that affect the number of neural function evaluations?\n- The use of some parameters like K is not clearly shown in Algorithm 2. It should be used as an argument to the optimization block.\n- After discussion: I thank the authors for their response. The idea of tuning the prompts used in SoTA inverse problem solvers is an important contribution. However, the proposed algorithm currently takes around 30 mins to process one single image as opposed to 5 mins for DPS and 7 mins for PSLD/GML-DPS. I understand that the current work is at its early stage and its runtime might improve in the near future. I believe the current score \"marginally above acceptance threshold (6/10)\" is a good assessment of the proposed method. Therefore, I am planning to keep my score.\n\n**Soundness:**\n2 fair\n\n**Presentation:**\n3 good\n\n**Contribution:**\n3 good\n\n**Rating:**\n5 marginally below the acceptance threshold\n\n**Paper Decision:**\n- Decision: Reject\n- Reasons: The decision to reject is based on several factors. First, the paper lacks a theoretical analysis of convergence, which is crucial for understanding the method's reliability and effectiveness. Second, the results are not very promising, with subtle performance gains and insignificant differences in ablation experiments. Third, the practicality of the proposed method is limited, with the method being significantly slower and requiring extensive hyper-parameter tuning compared to existing methods. Lastly, the writing is poor and the submission is hard to follow, which affects the clarity and accessibility of the research. Despite the innovative approach of optimizing prompts for inverse problem solving, these issues outweigh the strengths of the paper.",

  "code": "**Summary:**\nThe paper introduces SA3DIP, a novel method for 3D instance segmentation that leverages both geometric and textural priors to enhance the accuracy of segmentation tasks. SA3DIP integrates these priors to generate finer-grained 3D primitives, reducing initial errors that accumulate in subsequent processes. It also incorporates constraints from a 3D detector during the merging process to rectify over-segmented instances, maintaining the integrity of objects in 3D space. The paper also introduces a revised version of the ScanNetV2 dataset, termed ScanNetV2-INS, with enhanced ground truth labels for more accurate and fair evaluations of 3D class-agnostic instance segmentation methods. Extensive experiments on ScanNetV2, ScanNetV2-INS, and ScanNet++ datasets demonstrate the effectiveness and robustness of SA3DIP, achieving significant improvements in segmentation accuracy over existing methods.\n\n**Strengths:**\n- The SA3DIP pipeline integrates both geometric and color priors to generate complementary 3D primitives, enhancing the segmentation process.\n- The introduction of a 3D detector provides additional constraints during the merging process, addressing over-segmentation issues.\n- The revised ScanNetV2-INS dataset with improved annotations provides a more accurate benchmark for evaluating 3D instance segmentation methods.\n- The paper demonstrates superior performance in 3D instance segmentation through extensive experiments on multiple datasets, achieving competitive results.\n- The method addresses the limitations of previous approaches by fully exploiting the potential of 3D priors, leading to more accurate and reliable 3D instance segmentation results.\n\n**Weaknesses:**\n- The enhancement metrics contributions by individual features are not clearly delineated, and ablation studies could be performed more meticulously to attribute the contribution of each feature individually.\n- The use of RGB values only as texture prior is not robust enough due to their susceptibility to variations caused by lighting conditions, shadows, reflections, and object materials.\n- The paper reports only the class-agnostic instance segmentation results of SA3DIP, and it would be beneficial to include semantic instance segmentation results for a more comprehensive evaluation.\n- The method requires posed images, which may not be a requirement for competitors, and the images are often difficult to parse, which could affect the reproducibility of the results.\n- The paper lacks sufficient documentation or analysis of the new annotations for ScanNetV2, which is critical since it is one of the core contributions of the paper.\n\n**Questions:**\n- What are the main assumptions made in the workflow, and what are the reasons and rationale for these choices?\n- Can the method work for subparts within a scene such as within a chair, and what is the level of detail considered?\n- What is the complexity of the pipeline in terms of computation, and how much improvement across the dataset can be expected?\n- More comprehensive experiments are needed to validate the effectiveness of the Complementary Primitives Generation module. Can the authors provide more details on how these vectors are derived and what their dimensions are?\n- Why is there no visual comparison in Figure 4 between SAMPro3D and the proposed method, especially since SAMPro3D is numerically closest to the proposed method?\n\n**Soundness:**\n3 good\n\n**Presentation:**\n3 good\n\n**Contribution:**\n2 fair\n\n**Rating:**\n6 marginally above the acceptance threshold\n\n**Paper Decision:**\n- Decision: Accept\n- Reasons: The paper received all positive scores from the reviewers, highlighting its technical solidity and high impact on the field of 3D instance segmentation. The methodology effectively integrates geometric and textural priors to enhance segmentation accuracy, and the revised dataset provides a more accurate benchmark for evaluating 3D segmentation methods. The reviewers were particularly impressed by the responses from the authors during the rebuttal phase, which addressed the concerns raised during the initial review. The decision to accept is supported by the meta-review, which emphasizes the originality, methodological soundness, and significance of the results. The paper is encouraged to include the important clarifications into the final paper when preparing the camera-ready version.",

All versions of GNU Radio used by the authors\nsupport ``throttle2`` and consider ``throttle`` as deprecated, but in case of error when opening flowgraphs using GNU Radio Companion\nrelated to ``throttle2``, please switch to the ``throttle`` branch (``git checkout throttle``) where all ``throttle2`` have been\nreplaced with ``throttle``.\n\n## Feedback\n\nPlease provide constructive feedback (jmfriedt AT femto-st.fr) on how to improve the book: we will provide\nupdates on the Git repository accordingly. We appreciate comments on \n<a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/product-reviews/1394218885/ref=acr_dpx_hist_5?ie=UTF8&filterByStar=five_star&reviewerType=all_reviews#reviews-filter-bar\">Amazon</a> such as\n\"Informative but packed with errors…: Really good information & authors seem to know what they are doing. But the sloppiness is excessive & the lazy mistakes are frustrating.\" but would appreciate a list of the lazy mistakes so we can \nupdate, since the manuscript was thoroughly proofread by the editors and ourselves.\n\nA review was published in <a href=\"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=11150353\">the october 2025 issue of IEEE microwave magazine</a>.\n",

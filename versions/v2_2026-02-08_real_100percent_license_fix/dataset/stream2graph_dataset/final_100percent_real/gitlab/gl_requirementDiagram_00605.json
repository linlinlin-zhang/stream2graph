  "code": "**Summary:**\nThe paper introduces a novel algorithm, Lie NAG-SC, which accelerates optimization on Lie groups by applying techniques from optimization theory over manifolds. The authors analyze the convergence rates of the Lie group momentum optimizer and extend acceleration techniques from Euclidean to Lie group settings. They provide theoretical analysis and experimental verification, demonstrating the method's effectiveness in local convergence scenarios. The paper also discusses the challenges of entering the local region of convergence and the impact of parameters on the optimization process.\n\n**Strengths:**\n- The paper provides the first quantitative analysis of Lie group momentum optimizers, which is significant as there are no nontrivial convex functions on many Lie groups.\n- The theoretical analysis is advanced, and the authors extend techniques from Euclidean optimization to the Lie group case, which is both intuitive and rigorous.\n- The authors apply the theories from optimization over general manifolds to considering optimization over Lie groups, providing analytical and tractable formulas.\n- The paper is well-written, and the authors provide intuitive explanations for the theories, making the content accessible and understandable.\n- The discrete version of the energy function and the Lyapunov function from the continuous version are insightful, potentially helpful for understanding similar problems related to discrete dynamic systems.\n\n**Weaknesses:**\n- The paper only considers local convergence, which may not generalize to cases where the optimizer is initiated far from the global optimum.\n- The motivation for the study is not clearly presented, and the novelty of the work compared to existing literature, such as [1], is not adequately discussed.\n- The requirement that the manifold be a Lie group is very restrictive, and the paper fails to cite many important prior works, particularly those that discuss acceleration on Riemannian manifolds.\n- The paper does not sufficiently discuss the impact of the parameter p(a) on the rates and the intuition behind this parameter.\n- The experiments performed are limited, and the paper does not adequately address the high-level mathematical terminologies used, which may be confusing for readers without a strong background in the field.\n\n**Questions:**\n- Could the authors numerically compare the different methods when started from the same random initialisation, far away from the global optimum?\n- How does the parameter p(a) impact the rates, and can the authors explain the intuition for this parameter in the introduction?\n- Is it possible to show more experimental results in other problems and compare them with the results in [1]?\n- In the article, a function U is defined as convex on G, where G⊂RN is embedded in Euclidean space. Is this correct?\n- For equation (16), does dξlog⁡g mean (dlog)g(ξ), i.e., the differential of the logarithm at point g mapping ξ?\n- Is it necessary to use the exponential map as the retraction? From the reviewer's experience, for the manifold SO(n), using the matrix exponential is more expensive than using the QR-retraction.\n\n**Soundness:**\n3 good\n\n**Presentation:**\n2 fair\n\n**Contribution:**\n2 fair\n\n**Rating:**\n6 marginally above the acceptance threshold\n\n**Paper Decision:**\n- Decision: Accept\n- Reasons: The paper presents a novel algorithm that accelerates optimization on Lie groups, which is a significant contribution to the field. Despite the limitations noted, such as the restrictive nature of the Lie group requirement and the focus on local convergence, the theoretical analysis and experimental verification support the paper's claims. The reviewers have highlighted the potential for further improvements in clarity and the discussion of practical applications, which the authors should address in the final version. The decision to accept is based on the paper's technical solidity, its high impact on the sub-area of optimization on Lie groups, and the overall positive reception of the methodology and results.",

  "code": "**Summary:**\nThe paper explores the issue of Outlier Features (OFs) in neural networks, specifically focusing on transformers where certain neurons exhibit significantly higher activation levels than others. These OFs can hinder model quantization and their emergence during training is poorly understood. The study introduces quantitative metrics like kurtosis to measure OFs and investigates how architectural and optimization choices affect their occurrence. The authors propose the Outlier Protected transformer block, which removes standard Pre-Norm layers to reduce OFs without compromising convergence speed or stability. The paper also discusses the relationship between signal propagation and OFs and provides practical insights to mitigate OFs during training.\n\n**Strengths:**\n- The paper introduces metrics such as kurtosis of neuron activation norms to quantify Outlier Features (OFs) in neural networks, providing a clear and quantitative definition of OFs.\n- It provides insights into how architectural and optimization choices influence the emergence of OFs during transformer training.\n- The study proposes the Outlier Protected transformer block, which removes standard Pre-Norm layers to mitigate OFs without impacting training stability or convergence speed.\n- Findings are supported by empirical validation across various datasets, demonstrating the effectiveness of the proposed metrics and strategies.\n- The paper is well written, making claims that are well supported by the experiments and is relatively easy to understand.\n- The topic is relevant, and the authors made a sufficiently large contribution to the research of OFs.\n- The paper is well-structured, with formal definitions and clear explanations of the experimental design and results.\n\n**Weaknesses:**\n- The paper is poorly written, with claims and evidence listed in a piecemeal fashion rather than being unified into a structured story.\n- The evidence provided for the Outlier Protected Block (OP) is insufficient to support the claim that it reduces OFs.\n- The paper lacks depth in its training design analysis and fails to adequately address the core question of why OFs emerge during training.\n- The building blocks for the OP block are not adequately explained, which could be confusing for practitioners unfamiliar with the literature.\n- The experimental design could be expanded to include larger-scale experiments, particularly with transformers in the vision domain, to strengthen the message of the paper.\n- The paper lacks a solid contribution and fails to adequately answer the research question of \"why OFs emerge during training.\"\n- There are several typographical and mathematical errors throughout the paper, which could detract from its professionalism and clarity.\n\n**Questions:**\n- Can the authors clarify the selection and update details of the parameter β in the OP module?\n- How does the OP module perform in larger transformers or in different training schemes?\n- Why is the OP module designed to add all parameters before the residual connection, and what are the implications for eliminating outliers in the input X of the first block?\n- How does the OFs metric using the OP module behave with increasing \"Token seen\"?\n- Could the authors provide more detailed experimental results or additional experiments to support the claims made about the OP module?\n- How does the paper address the potential issues with the theory mentioned in the paper, particularly the off-diagonals on the left-hand side of equation 4?\n\n**Soundness:**\n3 good\n\n**Presentation:**\n3 good\n\n**Contribution:**\n3 good\n\n**Rating:**\n6 marginally above the acceptance threshold\n\n**Paper Decision:**\n- Decision: Accept\n- Reasons: The paper presents a novel approach to reducing outlier features in neural network training, which is a significant issue in the field. The methodological soundness of the study is supported by rigorous experimental validation and the introduction of quantitative metrics for measuring OFs. The paper has sparked considerable discussion and debate, with concerns primarily centered around the depth of technical contribution and the clarity of writing. However, the authors have comprehensively addressed these issues in their rebuttal, providing additional data and clarifications that enhance the original submission. The decision to accept is contingent upon the successful incorporation of suggested improvements in its final version.",

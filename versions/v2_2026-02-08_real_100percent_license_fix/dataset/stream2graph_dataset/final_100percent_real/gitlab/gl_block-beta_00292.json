  "code": "**Summary:**\nThe paper introduces a novel block-wise pruning technique named BESA for compressing large language models (LLMs) by optimizing pruning rates across different layers in a differentiable manner. This method aims to address the computational footprint and memory consumption issues associated with LLMs. BESA is evaluated on various models and datasets, including LLaMA1 and LLaMA2, and is shown to achieve state-of-the-art performance in pruning these models, with reduced performance degradation after pruning. The method is parameter-efficient and can be jointly optimized with weight-only quantization techniques, enhancing the compression ratio and efficiency of LLMs.\n\n**Strengths:**\n- BESA is the first differentiable pruning algorithm for LLMs, which allows for efficient optimization of pruning rates across layers.\n- The method is parameter-efficient and easy to optimize, exhibiting high efficiency and effectiveness in pruning various LLMs.\n- BESA achieves state-of-the-art performance in pruning various LLMs, such as LLaMA1 and LLaMA2, with reduced performance degradation after pruning.\n- The proposed method can be jointly optimized with weight-only quantization techniques, further enhancing the compression ratio and efficiency of LLMs.\n- The practical speedup of the pruned model in a hardware simulator is demonstrated.\n- Extensive experiments have been conducted on language modeling and few-shot learning benchmark datasets, exploring models with different numbers of parameters from 7b to 70b.\n\n**Weaknesses:**\n- The paper does not provide a detailed analysis of the trade-offs between different pruning rates and their impact on model performance, which could be useful for understanding the optimal pruning strategy.\n- There is a lack of comprehensive comparison of BESA with other pruning techniques, such as structured pruning, which could help in understanding the relative strengths and weaknesses of the proposed method.\n- The computational cost of attention weight in Table 4 is not included, which could affect the understanding of the overall computational efficiency of the proposed method.\n- The ablation study of block-wise pruning is not directly compared to pruning all models instead of layer by layer, which could provide a more comprehensive understanding of the effectiveness of the proposed method.\n- The paper does not clearly explain the advantages of BESA over other baselines, particularly in terms of differentiably optimizing masks, which is not clearly distinguished from other methods.\n\n**Questions:**\n- Could you provide a significant test to compare the model's performance with SparseGPT, especially in zero-shot tasks, to clarify if there is a significant difference in performance?\n- How does the computational cost of attention weight affect the overall efficiency of the proposed method, and could you include this in future experiments?\n- Could you clarify the advantages of BESA over other baselines, particularly in terms of differentiably optimizing masks, and how these advantages translate into practical improvements in model performance?\n- Would implementing specialized neural network accelerators (ViTCoD in the experiments) consume additional time or make the model faster than others?\n\n**Soundness:**\n3 good\n\n**Presentation:**\n3 good\n\n**Contribution:**\n3 good\n\n**Rating:**\n6 marginally above the acceptance threshold\n\n**Paper Decision:**\n- Decision: Accept\n- Reasons: The paper presents a novel approach to compressing LLMs through block-wise pruning with a differentiable sparsity allocation, which maintains the performance of LLMs well and improves computational efficiency compared to existing methods. The method is well-explained, and the experimental design is solid, with credible results that increase the credibility of the paper. The method's practical speedup in a hardware simulator and its ability to jointly optimize with weight-only quantization techniques further enhance its utility. Despite some concerns regarding the detailed analysis of trade-offs and the comprehensive comparison with other pruning techniques, the overall contribution and soundness of the paper justify its acceptance.",

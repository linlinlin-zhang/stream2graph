  "code": "**Model Diversity:**  Our platform currently supports only OpenAI’s models, chosen for their leading-edge capabilities and robust API access. This model-specific dependency could limit the platform’s flexibility, as different models may offer unique strengths and capabilities that could be beneficial in diverse research scenarios. We are therefore actively testing other open source and commercial AI models to potentially integrate into our platform (Bai et al., 2022; Touvron et al., 2023), thus expanding its versatility and research applicability. It should be noted that we avoid models that essentially add new prompt-engineering layers on top of base ALMs to improve decision performance in specific tasks (Shinn et al., 2023; Yao et al., 2023). \n\n**Realistic Condition Profiles:**  A minor drawback of our platform is the occasional generation of unrealistic agent profiles due to the randomness of profile construction. This approach also means that sometimes we end up with “interesting” agent profile combinations that may seldom present in the real world (e.g., a male lesbian). While rare, these cases can disrupt the research process and lead to unrealistic model responses. One solution lies in conditional profile construction, where agent attributes are selected based on real-world prevalence and correlations. However, it is important to note that this randomness can sometimes yield unique case studies that might not have been otherwise considered, offering unexpected insights and interesting research avenues. \n\n**Multi-Agent Games and Interaction:**  Currently, SurveyLM allows for the simulation of an agent’s participation in games with other players only when the other players and interaction rules are hard-coded into the uploaded questions and answer instruction. However, we are yet to develop the capacity for interactions between different agents within the same simulated population. To achieve this, a series of sophisticated enhancements would be necessary. Key among these improvements is the ability to form and manage groups of agents. These groups function as independent social entities, engaging in intricate social interactions within their own set boundaries. In this envisioned application, users could define group sizes, roles within these groups (e.g., the proposer and responder roles in the ultimatum game), and any variations thereof. Furthermore, we would offer the ability to set randomisation parameters for both roles and variations, adding yet another layer of complexity and realism to the simulations. Another captivating idea under this future avenue is the introduction of a chat function between different agents. This feature would allow the observation of direct communication patterns and language use within and across agent groups, offering researchers another dimension to their social agent studies. \n\nIn summary, while our platform faces certain limitations, we view these as opportunities for growth and enhancement. Our commitment to continuous development and user satisfaction drives us to persistently explore innovative solutions to these challenges. This means that we are open for feedback and suggestions. As we progress on this journey, we look forward to unlocking further potential in facilitating complex research through advanced ALM models. \n\nFor beta access and further details about the SurveyLM platform, please contact the corresponding author of this paper.

  "code": "**Summary:**\nThe paper introduces \"Keqing,\" a novel framework designed to enhance the performance of Large Language Models (LLMs) in knowledge-based question answering (KBQA). Keqing integrates an Information Retrieval (IR) module to systematically guide LLMs in answering complex questions by extracting structured information from a knowledge graph. This methodology not only improves the trustworthiness and interpretability of LLM responses but also automates the KBQA process with minimal additional effort. The framework is evaluated on various datasets, demonstrating its effectiveness in handling complex queries and achieving state-of-the-art performance.\n\n**Strengths:**\n- The paper presents a comprehensive four-stage workflow (decomposition, retrieval, reasoning, and response generation) for knowledge-based question answering, offering a systematic approach to the problem.\n- The framework guarantees that the produced answers are not only accurate but also transparent, revealing the logical journey leading to the conclusion.\n- Experimental results show the effectiveness of the approach on two KBQA benchmarks, and adapt question logical forms to aid chain of thought prompting in LLMs for KBQA.\n- The paper is well-written, making it easy to read and understand, and the authors have effectively motivated the design using existing techniques and datasets.\n- The experiments conducted on GrailQA, WebQ, and MetaQA validate the effectiveness of the framework.\n\n**Weaknesses:**\n- The title of the paper is somewhat misleading, obscuring the main contribution, which is the integration of an IR module to derive structured data from a knowledge graph.\n- The novelty of the approach is ambiguous, as elements like question decomposition and candidate reasoning are not new to the field.\n- The paper does not clearly distinguish itself from traditional KBQA systems, and the performance in a few-shot scenario lags behind state-of-the-art models like Decaf.\n- The methodology is criticized for being within the paradigm of the art of alchemy, with processes like question decomposition, selection, and reasoning being black boxes.\n- The paper could benefit from improved writing and consistent referencing throughout the document.\n\n**Questions:**\n- Could you clarify the relationship between the pipeline described and the concept of CoT?\n- In terms of originality, how does the proposed framework distinguish itself from traditional KBQA systems?\n- The results indicate that the model's performance in a few-shot learning scenario is not on par with state-of-the-art models like Decaf. Could you shed light on the reasons behind this disparity?\n- How are the answers for KBQA extracted for final F1 measure, especially since LLMs generate free text?\n- Can the authors illustrate the runtime and memory complexity of their work, as it is highly dependent upon LLMs which incur large runtime for fine-tuning?\n- Can you provide one error case to illustrate the limitation of the current Keqing system?\n\n**Soundness:**\n2 fair\n\n**Presentation:**\n3 good\n\n**Contribution:**\n2 fair\n\n**Rating:**\n3 reject, not good enough\n\n**Paper Decision:**\n- Decision: Reject\n- Reasons: The decision to reject is based on several factors. First, the novelty of the approach is questioned, as elements like question decomposition and candidate reasoning are not new to the field. Second, the paper's methodology is criticized for being within the paradigm of the art of alchemy, with processes like question decomposition, selection, and reasoning being black boxes. Third, the performance in a few-shot scenario lags behind state-of-the-art models, and the paper does not clearly distinguish itself from traditional KBQA systems. Lastly, the writing and referencing throughout the document need improvement. These factors collectively suggest that the paper does not meet the acceptance threshold at this stage.",

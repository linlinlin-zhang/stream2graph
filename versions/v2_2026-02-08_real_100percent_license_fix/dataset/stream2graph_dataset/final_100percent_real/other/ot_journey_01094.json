  "code": "**Summary:**\nThe paper introduces ColJailBreak, a novel framework designed to bypass safety filters in commercial text-to-image models by transforming safe images into unsafe counterparts using image segmentation and editing techniques. The method involves three components: adaptive normal safe substitution, inpainting-driven injection of unsafe content, and contrastive language-image-guided collaborative optimization. The paper provides extensive evaluation results across multiple datasets, demonstrating the effectiveness of the proposed method in generating harmful content. However, concerns were raised about the limited datasets, insufficient baselines, and the practicality of the attack due to its computational cost and the potential for image editing to be the primary contributor to the harmful content generation.\n\n**Strengths:**\n- The paper is well-presented and provides extensive evaluation results.\n- The method is innovative, combining image generation and editing to bypass safety filters, which is different from traditional adversarial prompt techniques.\n- The attack strategy of post-hoc editing is novel and effective against proprietary text-to-image systems in a black-box setting.\n- The method is validated on multiple datasets and compared to existing baseline methods, demonstrating its effectiveness.\n- The paper is easy to follow, making the method accessible to practitioners and researchers.\n\n**Weaknesses:**\n- The intuition behind using a text-to-image model to generate normal images first and then modifying them is questionable.\n- The test datasets are relatively small and may not cover all types of unsafe content, such as fighting or pornographic exposure.\n- The attack pipeline is considered costly and not practical due to the need for additional model inferences (SAM and Inpainting models).\n- The method's reliance on open-source models for image editing raises questions about the necessity of using proprietary models for generating images in the first place.\n- The safety types considered are limited, and the method's effectiveness on other unsafe categories, such as nudity and graphic violence, is not demonstrated.\n- The alignment between the generation and the prompt is not thoroughly evaluated, with concerns about the method's ability to generate content that truly reflects the input prompt.\n- The paper does not fully evaluate the alignment between the generation and the prompt, and no human evaluation is included.\n\n**Questions:**\n- What is the possible application of these attacks?\n- Can the authors test other models like Midjourney and include more testing and human evaluation?\n- Could the authors present arguments or evidence to justify the method rather than simply relying on image editing?\n- Could more testing and human evaluation be added to better assess the effectiveness and safety implications of the proposed method?\n- How does the method ensure that the generated content aligns with the input prompt, and what measures are in place to prevent the generation of harmful content that does not reflect the intended prompt?\n\n**Soundness:**\n2 fair\n\n**Presentation:**\n2 fair\n\n**Contribution:**\n2 fair\n\n**Rating:**\n5 borderline accept\n\n**Paper Decision:**\n- Decision: Accept\n- Reasons: The paper presents a clear and simple method that effectively bypasses safety filters in text-to-image models, as evidenced by extensive evaluation results. While concerns about the limited datasets, insufficient baselines, and insufficient evaluation metrics were raised, these issues have been addressed in the rebuttal. The method's novelty and practical application, despite some limitations in its evaluation and practicality, tip the balance towards acceptance. The decision aligns with the meta-review, which highlights the paper's originality, methodological soundness, and significant contribution to the field.",

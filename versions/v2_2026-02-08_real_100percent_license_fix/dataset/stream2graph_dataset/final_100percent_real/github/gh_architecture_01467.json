  "code": "**Summary:**\nThe paper introduces Schur layers, a novel approach to enhance the expressive power of graph neural networks (GNNs) by leveraging spectral graph theory. This method bypasses the need to explicitly determine automorphism groups, which is computationally expensive, by constructing a basis for equivariant operations directly from the graph Laplacian. The approach is validated through experiments on the ZINC dataset, showing significant improvements over traditional GNNs in handling complex local structures, such as cycles within molecules/subgraphs. The paper also extends the P-tensor formalism to Subgraph GNNs and other high-order networks, potentially reducing the exponential search space of permutation equivariant layers.\n\n**Strengths:**\n- The paper introduces Schur layers, a novel architecture that enhances the expressive power of GNNs through higher order message passing, which is a significant contribution to the field.\n- The theoretical framework and mathematical rigor underpinning Schur layers are robust and well-explained, providing a solid foundation for the proposed method.\n- Schur Nets have shown impressive performance on the ZINC dataset, consistently outperforming other methods in experiments.\n- The approach is efficient as it does not require the identification of the full automorphism group of the subgraph, making it more computationally efficient than traditional group theoretic approaches.\n- The paper is well-written, with sections 1 and 2 being particularly well-articulated, introducing MPNNs based on the authors' understanding of equivariance in an interesting and novel way.\n\n**Weaknesses:**\n- The paper suffers from numerous spelling and grammar errors, incorrect citations, and lacks clarity in the theoretical background, making it difficult for readers to fully understand the contributions.\n- The experimental evaluation is limited, focusing only on the ZINC dataset, which may not adequately demonstrate the broader applicability of the proposed method.\n- The paper lacks a detailed discussion on the expressiveness of Schur Nets and how they compare to other models, which is crucial for understanding the theoretical contributions.\n- The theoretical contributions, such as the theorems and their implications, are not well-explained, and the paper lacks an intuitive explanation of the theoretical aspects.\n- The paper is not reproducible as the code is not supplied, which is a significant drawback for verifying the results and replicating the experiments.\n\n**Questions:**\n- How were Schur layers implemented in the experiments? Was equation (8) simply applied to the features of the subgraphs?\n- What is the intuitive meaning behind Theorem 1, Theorem 2, and Theorem 3?\n- How does the computational complexity of Schur layers compare to traditional GNN approaches in terms of training time and memory usage?\n- How sensitive are the performance gains of Schur layers to different types of molecular datasets beyond the benchmarks used in the paper?\n- How does the expressivity of Schur layers compare to other models, and what are the theoretical guarantees on its expressivity?\n\n**Soundness:**\n2 fair\n\n**Presentation:**\n2 fair\n\n**Contribution:**\n3 good\n\n**Rating:**\n5 marginally above the acceptance threshold\n\n**Paper Decision:**\n- Decision: Accept\n- Reasons: The paper introduces a novel method that significantly reduces the computational complexity of permutation equivariant layers in GNNs by leveraging spectral graph theory. The approach is validated through experiments on the ZINC dataset, showing significant improvements over traditional GNNs. Despite some clarity issues in the theoretical sections and a limited scope of experiments, the paper's novelty and potential impact on the field justify its acceptance. The decision is also supported by the positive feedback from reviewers regarding the method's efficiency and theoretical contributions. However, the authors are encouraged to refine the clarity and depth of their explanations in the final version to enhance the paper's accessibility and impact.",

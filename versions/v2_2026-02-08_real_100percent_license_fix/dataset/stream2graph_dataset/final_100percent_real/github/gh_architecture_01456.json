  "code": "**Summary:**\nThe paper introduces a novel algorithm, LLwLC, which extends the Lanczos algorithm to encode subgraph information via a captured eigenbasis of a constrained Laplacian matrix. This approach aims to address the limited expressiveness of traditional GNNs by explicitly encoding linear constraints over the graph, enhancing the ability to distinguish between different graph structures, particularly in link prediction tasks. The methodology involves projecting approximated eigenvectors with a Neumann constraint matrix to encode the relation between nodes, which is claimed to be more expressive and effective than existing methods. The paper presents numerical experiments that demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed method, achieving state-of-the-art results on benchmark datasets.\n\n**Strengths:**\n- The paper introduces a novel spectral GNN structure, offering an insightful exploration of utilizing linear constraints on subgraph structures in eigenspaces.\n- The proposed LLwLC has the capability to distinguish k-regular graphs, which is an improvement over MPNNs.\n- Numerical experiments suggest that the proposed algorithm can attain high accuracy versus other competitive approaches.\n- The paper is technically solid and provides a novel approach to encoding link representations, which is crucial for link prediction tasks.\n\n**Weaknesses:**\n- The language and presentation of the paper could be further improved, particularly in figures and visual representations.\n- The motivation behind applying LLwLC in link prediction tasks is not well-explained, especially given that the propagation process appears to be a learnable spectral graph filter.\n- The paper lacks a detailed comparison of the computational complexities and wall-clock times, which are crucial for evaluating the efficiency of the proposed method.\n- The implementation of the proposed model is not accessible, making it difficult for others to reproduce the experiments and further validate the results.\n- The paper is not very clear, and some sections read as textbook-style material, which could be simplified or removed for better clarity.\n\n**Questions:**\n- What motivated the application of LLwLC in link prediction tasks? How does the model's performance compare in other node-wise downstream tasks, such as node classification?\n- Can you prove the superiority of LLwLC over MPNNs on a wider range of 1-WL isomorphism graphs?\n- Can you provide information about the computational complexity of the proposed LLwLC algorithm?\n- How does the model handle the node automorphism issue, and can it address the limitation of MPNNs in counting sub-structures and triangles (beyond the expressiveness inherited from subgraph-based models)?\n- Can the Neumann features be applied to more than 2-hop neighborhoods, and what is the complexity of the proposed method to extract a bag of subgraphs, obtain δS, and construct C for each link?\n\n**Soundness:**\n2 fair\n\n**Presentation:**\n2 fair\n\n**Contribution:**\n2 fair\n\n**Rating:**\n3 reject, not good enough\n\n**Paper Decision:**\n- Decision: Reject\n- Reasons: The paper, while introducing a novel approach to encoding link representations, suffers from several critical issues that lead to its rejection. The presentation of the paper is considered poor, with unclear motivations and insufficient clarity in explaining the methodology and its application to link prediction tasks. The paper lacks detailed comparisons of computational complexities and wall-clock times, which are crucial for evaluating the efficiency of the proposed method. Additionally, the theoretical analysis provided is not novel enough to justify the claims of significant advancement over existing methods. The reviewers also pointed out that the paper does not sufficiently address the scalability and computational overhead of the subgraph-based approach, which is a significant limitation for larger datasets. The decision to reject is based on these substantial shortcomings in the paper's presentation, methodological soundness, and significance of results.",

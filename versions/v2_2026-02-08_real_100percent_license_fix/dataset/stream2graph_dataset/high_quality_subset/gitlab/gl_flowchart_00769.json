She does not need to improvise\n        last-second defenses. She notices openings well\n        before they appear. She can choose her blows precisely,\n        selecting multiple actions that combine harmoniously.\n        In the turn in which she invokes this Charm, the\n        character can take two extra attack actions, using Archery,\n        Brawl, Melee or Thrown. Sidereal Exalted may\n        always use their Temperance with this Charm.<br>\n        This Charm is explicitly permitted to be in a\n        Combo with Charms of other Abilities. Note that the\n        rules on Combos may limit the kinds of actions a\n        character can take.\n        \"\n\n    meditation_on_war[Meditation on War]\n    harmony_of_blows --> meditation_on_war\n    click meditation_on_war callback \"\n        Meditation on War<br>\n        <br>\n        Cost: 1 mote per die + 1 mote per dice pool penalty cancelled<br>\n        Duration: Instant<br>\n        Type: Supplemental<br>\n        Minimum Melee: 3<br>\n        Minimum Essence: 2<br>\n        Prerequisite Charms: Harmony of Blows<br>\n        <br>\n        Calm and precision envelops the character as she\n        strikes. She adds dice to one Melee attack, increasing it\n        to a maximum of its normal pool plus the character's\n        Essence. For example, an Essence 3 character who has a\n        - 1 wound penalty can spend up to 4 motes to enhance her\n        attack. This can overcome penalties that reduce the\n        character's dice pool to 0 before Charms. Sidereal Exalted\n        may always use their Temperance with this Charm.\n        \"\n\n    orchestration_of_conflict[Orchestration of Conflict]\n    harmony_of_blows --> orchestration_of_conflict\n    click orchestration_of_conflict callback \"\n        Orchestration of Conflict<br>\n        <br>\n        Cost: 2 motes per target number reduction<br>\n        Duration: Instant<br>\n        Type: Supplemental<br>\n        Minimum Melee: 3<br>\n        Minimum Essence: 2<br>\n        Prerequisite Charms: Harmony of Blows<br>\n        <br>\n        Manipulating the local flow of a conflict through\n        the ripple effects of her own actions, the character\n        reduces the target number for a Melee attack or parry.\n        \"\n\n    impeding_the_flow[Impeding the Flow]\n    click impeding_the_flow callback \"\n        Impeding the Flow<br>\n        <br>\n        Cost: 3 motes<br>\n        Duration: Instant<br>\n        Type: Reflexive<br>\n        Minimum Melee: 2<br>\n        Minimum Essence: 1<br>\n        Prerequisite Charms: None<br>\n        <br>\n        A wind full of red stardust and the character's will,\n        visible to those who can see dematerialized spirits, spins\n        around the character. It reroutes the flows of Essence and\n        fate that normally allow others to attack her. A casual\n        movement of the Exalt's weapon parries any one incoming\n        attack she is aware of, so long as the attack has a\n        physical component and is not specifically noted as\n        impossible to block. This is not a perfect defense.\n        \"\n\n    serenity_in_blood[Serenity in Blood]\n    harmony_of_blows --> serenity_in_blood\n    impeding_the_flow --> serenity_in_blood\n    click serenity_in_blood callback \"\n        Serenity in Blood<br>\n        <br>\n        Cost: 5 motes, 1 Willpower<br>\n        Duration: Instant<br>\n        Type: Reflexive<br>\n        Minimum Melee: 4<br>\n        Minimum Essence: 2<br>\n        Prerequisite Charms: Harmony of Blows, Impeding the Flow<br>\n        <br>\n        Stirring the currents of fate with the tip of her weapon,\n        the character disrupts the path of any attack made against\n        her, so long as it passes through any portion of the world\n        bound by fate. If she is unaware of the attack, her player\n        must make a reflexive Perception + Melee roll at difficulty\n        3 to divert the blow. Otherwise, this is a perfect block,\n        capable of stopping even unblockable attacks.\n        \"\n\n    smiling_at_the_damned[Smiling at the Damned]\n    click smiling_at_the_damned callback \"\n        Smiling at the Damned<br>\n        <br>\n        Cost: 5 motes<br>\n        Duration: Instant<br>\n        Type: Supplemental<br>\n        Minimum Melee: 4<br>\n        Minimum Essence: 3<br>\n        Prerequisite Charms: None<br>\n        <br>\n        In the moment the character's weapon strikes true,\n        the colors around her take on a harsh red tinge. Essence\n        dissolves at the weapon's touch. Halve the raw damage\n        for one attack, rounding down, but the damage is aggravated.\n        Sidereal Exalted may always use their Conviction\n        with this Charm.\n        \"\n\n    perfection_of_the_visionary_warrior[Perfection of the Visionary Warrior]\n    meditation_on_war --> perfection_of_the_visionary_warrior\n    orchestration_of_conflict --> perfection_of_the_visionary_warrior\n    serenity_in_blood --> perfection_of_the_visionary_warrior\n    smiling_at_the_damned --> perfection_of_the_visionary_warrior\n    click perfection_of_the_visionary_warrior callback \"\n        Perfection of the Visionary Warrior<br>\n        <br>\n        Cost: 10 motes, 1 Willpower, 1 health level<br>\n        Duration: One scene<br>\n        Type: Simple<br>\n        Minimum Melee: 5<br>\n        Minimum Essence: 3<br>\n        Prerequisite Charms: Meditation on War, Orchestration of Conflict, Serenity in Blood, Smiling at the Damned<br>\n        <br>\n        This Charm uses a prayer strip marked with the\n        scripture of the Maiden on the Shelf. The character\n        places it across his eyes, whereupon it adheres and begins\n        to drip with dark blood.\n        The character suffers no visibility penalties. All\n        opponents and attacks become apparent to him, although\n        effects such as the Mental Invisibility Technique can\n        force him to ignore them. He sees enemies not as bodies\n        and faces but as patterns of fate and potential or — for\n        creatures outside of fate — disruptions in such patterns.\n        The character can reflexively parry any blockable\n        attack with his full Dexterity + Melee dice pool. Once\n        per turn, after his initiative, he can reflexively make an\n        Archery, Brawl, Melee or Thrown attack at his full dice\n        pool. He cannot use the latter ability in any turn where\n        he splits his normal dice pool.\n        \"\n",
